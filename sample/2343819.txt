Ben Weisman (November 16, 1921 – May 20, 2007) was an American composer who wrote more songs recorded by Elvis Presley (fifty seven) than any other songwriter. The Mad Professor as Weisman was nicknamed by Presley, worked with Presley from 1956 ("First in Line") to 1971 ("Change of Habit"). Their early association (1957–62) produced many of the most powerful rockers and poignant ballads in Presley's repertoire, including "Got a Lot o' Livin' to Do", "Follow That Dream", "Rock-A-Hula Baby", "Crawfish", "As Long as I Have You", "Pocketful of Rainbows" and "Fame and Fortune".
