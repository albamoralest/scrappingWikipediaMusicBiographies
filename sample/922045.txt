Gerard Marsden MBE (24 September 1942 â€“ 3 January 2021) was an English singer-songwriter, musician and television personality, best known for being leader of the Merseybeat band Gerry and the Pacemakers. He was the younger brother of fellow band member Freddie Marsden.
Gerry and the Pacemakers had the distinction of being the first act to have their first three recordings go to number 1 in the UK charts. Although they never had a number 1 in the United States, they were the second-most successful group from Liverpool, after the Beatles, to have hits on the United States pop charts. Their 1965 musical film Ferry Cross the Mersey was co-written by Tony Warren.


== Early life ==
Marsden was born at 8 Menzies Street, Toxteth, Liverpool, to Frederick Marsden and Mary McAlindin. His interest in music began at an early age. He remembered standing on top of an air-raid shelter singing "Ragtime Cowboy Joe", and getting a great reception from onlookers.


== Career ==
Gerry and the Pacemakers formed in 1959. They were the second group signed by Brian Epstein, the first being the Beatles, and remained among his favourite artists. Their first single was 1963's "How Do You Do It?", recommended by George Martin after it was initially given to the Beatles. This was the first number one hit for the Pacemakers. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and was released on EMI's Columbia label.The group's second number one was "I Like It", followed by "You'll Never Walk Alone", both released later in 1963. The group's other singles included "It's Gonna Be Alright", "I'm the One", "Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying", and "Ferry Cross the Mersey", all released in 1964. A musical film Ferry Cross the Mersey, considered to be their version of the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night, was co-written by Coronation Street creator and writer Tony Warren, and was released in 1965.The Pacemakers disbanded in October 1966. After leaving the group, Marsden maintained a low-key career on television, including a regular slot on children's television in The Sooty Show. He also starred in the West End musical Charlie Girl alongside Derek Nimmo and Anna Neagle, replacing another pop singer, Joe Brown. A new song, "Liverpool", was added to the score to tie in with Marsden's Liverpool accent.Marsden returned to #1 in the charts twice during the 1980s with re-recordings of two of his old hits, with all profits going to charity. In 1985 after the Bradford Football Club stadium tragedy in which 56 were killed, he formed a group called the Crowd, which included other musicians, singers, and radio disc jockeys, to produce a new version of "You'll Never Walk Alone".On 18 April 1989, three days after the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool F.C. fans died, he joined forces with Paul McCartney, the Christians, Holly Johnson, and his production trio Stock, Aitken & Waterman on a new version of "Ferry Cross the Mersey".In 1993 Marsden published his autobiography, I'll Never Walk Alone, co-written with former Melody Maker editor Ray Coleman. In 1990, he recorded the song "Red White and Blue", with The England Supporters Club, that also appears on the Euro 96 album England's Glory.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he released a version of "You'll Never Walk Alone" in tribute to the National Health Service.
