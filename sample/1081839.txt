Shirley Alston Reeves (born June 10, 1941 in Henderson, North Carolina), born Shirley Owens, is an American soul singer who was the main lead singer of the hit girl group the Shirelles. In addition to Owens, the Shirelles consisted of classmates of hers from Passaic High School, New Jersey: Doris Kenner Jackson, Addie "Micki" Harris McPhadden and Beverly Lee. Through marriages, she became Shirley Alston and later, Shirley Alston Reeves. Her strong, distinctive voice meant that she was the natural choice for their main lead singer, though Jackson was also featured as lead on several songs as well. Her nephew, Gerald Alston is the lead singer of The Manhattans.
Reeves enjoyed a string of hits with the Shirelles throughout the 1960s, the most notable being Will You Love Me Tomorrow.  She left the Shirelles in 1975 to begin a solo career, initially recording under the name "Lady Rose". That same year, she recorded an album entitled With A Little Help From My Friends, after the hit song by the Beatles, which featured members of the Flamingos, the Drifters, Shep and the Limelites, the Five Satins, the Belmonts, Danny & the Juniors, Herman's Hermits and La La Brooks of the Crystals.The Shirelles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. She also performed on the Doo Wop 51 PBS special in 2000, and continues to tour under the name 'Shirley Alston Reeves and her Shirelles'.
