Antony (de) Choudens (11 February 1849 – 15 July 1902) was one of the most notable French music publishers and an occasional composer.


== Life and business history ==
Choudens was born in Paris. He succeeded his father Antoine de Choudens (1825–1888), who had founded the Paris-based company in May 1844, and which had grown to importance following the successful publication of Charles Gounod's opera Faust in 1859. He was also the nephew of the librettist Émilien Pacini. He studied harmony with Georges Bizet.
From November 1874, Antony de Choudens participated with 10 percent in the shares of the company, with 80 percent held by his father and the remaining 10 percent by his brother Paul. Following the death of their father in November 1888, the brothers took over the company, with Antoine holding 40 percent and Paul 60 percent. The company closed down in 1914.
