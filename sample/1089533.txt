Jurgens translated a number of theological and musical works during his lifetime, and wrote books about early church theologians as well as the liturgy. Among these are:

Theological Dimensions of the Liturgy: A General Treatise on the Theology of the Liturgy. Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press. 1976. ISBN 9780814609286. (co-authored with Cipriano Vagaggini and Leonard J. Doyle)The three-volume Faith of the Early Fathers is now considered a standard patrological work. Catholic writer Karl Keating says it ranks with Joseph Tixeront's History of Dogmas and Johannes Quasten's Patrology as a fundamental collection of patrological works, the "premier work of its kind" and "prime reading for the apologist". Jurgens and Tixeront cover the same years, more so than Quasten. Jurgens' work is more inclusive and contains works from a greater variety of authors. Reviewing The Faith of the Early Fathers, scholar Herbert T. Mayer applauded the work's inclusiveness, the inclusion of canons and decrees, the length of excerpts (longer than in most works), Jurgens' doctrinal analysis, and the index (missing in many other works). He called it "a good history of the Christian church" suitable for seminaries.


=== Musical works ===
Jurgens was considered a composer and musician of some skill. He composed a number of musical works and published collections of existing works. These include:
