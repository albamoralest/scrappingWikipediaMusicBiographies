For a brief time, Jeff Kagel, then a student at State University of New York at Stony Brook, was the band's lead singer, but he quit.In August 1970 Krishna Das traveled to India, where, as Ram Dass had done, he became a devotee of the Hindu guru Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaj-ji).
He was referred to as the "Rockstar of Yoga" by the Grammys when he was nominated for a 2013 Grammy Award.Krishna Das has been associated with many other artists. Two of his albums have featured Hans Christian as a guest multi-instrumentalist, and Sting appears on the album Pilgrim Heart. He has also appeared on an album with Baird Hersey & Prana, a group combining Western music and overtone singing, entitled Gathering in the Light. Walter Becker of Steely Dan plays bass guitar on and co-produced All One (2010), which also features Rick Allen of Def Leppard on drums and Steve Gorn on flute.

== Anusara Yoga invocation ==
Krishna Das composed the melody for an Anusara Yoga invocation, Om Nama Shivaya Gurave, at the request of John Friend, founder of Anusara Yoga. Friend describes this composition as being written during a summer night at a secluded mountain retreat center in Utah in 1998.


== Zen Peacemakers chant ==
In the early 2000's Bernie Glassman founder of Zen Peacemakers asked Krishna Das to compose a melody for the chant Gates of Sweet Nectar, a traditional Japanese buddhist chant that had been translated to English by Glassman. After composing a melody Krishna Das realised it would work well with the Hanuman Chalisa both melodically and lyrically since the former is a desire to offer ones heart and the latter gives strength to follow through on a task.
