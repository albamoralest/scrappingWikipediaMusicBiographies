Garvin Bushell (né Garvin Lamont Payne; September 25, 1902 – October 31, 1991) was an American woodwind multi-instrumentalist.


== Biography ==
Bushell was born in Springfield, Ohio, to Alexander Payne, Jr. (1875–1908) and Effie Penn (maiden; 1879–1968). After his father's death, his mother – on January 12, 1910, in Covington, Kentucky – married Rev. Joseph Davenport Bushell (1878–1960). Garvin adopted the surname of his stepfather.
Bushell played both jazz and classical music on clarinet, alto clarinet, oboe, english horn, flute, saxophone, bassoon, and contrabassoon.
He was best known as a jazz sideman with people such as Perry Bradford, and performed and/or recorded with many of jazz's great names, such as Fletcher Henderson, Bunk Johnson, Fats Waller, Cab Calloway, Eric Dolphy, Gil Evans, and John Coltrane.
Bushell eventually settled in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he worked as a music teacher.
