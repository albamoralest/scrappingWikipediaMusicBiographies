César Roel Schreurs, best known as César Costa, is a Mexican actor and rock-and-roll singer.
Costa was born in Colonia Condesa of the Mexican capital. He studied elementary and Junior Highschool at the German College and Law at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).


== Music career ==
He started his musical career at the age of 17 as César Roel singing and playing guitar with the rock-and-roll band Los Black Jeans ("The Black Jeans"), singing Spanish versions of American hit singles as well as original songs like La batalla de Jericó. They recorded their first album in 1959 with Peerless Records. His backup singer was world-renowned tenor Plácido Domingo.
When the band signed with Musart Records the band changed its name to Los Camisas Negras ("The Black Shirts") and César Roel to Cesar Costa (honoring music arranger Don Costa). Soon after, the band disintegrated and César started a successful solo career, recording three albums with Orfeón Records. Then with RCA Mexicana he recorded romantic songs.
In 1983 he participated in the OTI Festival and obtained the second place with a song by Sergio Andrade titled Tierno ("Tender").

Supported by his success in the music industry, he joined other singers in films of the Cinema of Mexico such as 
Angélica María, Enrique Guzmán and Alberto Vázquez. In 1961 he made his first film Juventud Rebelde.
In 1986 he starred in the sitcom Papa soltero ("Single Dad"), a show that became a success in Latin America and then was adapted to the screen as Me tengo que casar ("I have to get married"). In the 1980s he hosted a comedy show "La Carabina De Ambrosio" and in the 1990s a talk show with model Rebecca de Alba called Un Nuevo Día and next year Al Fin de Semana.
In 1993 he presented a show together with Angélica María, Enrique Guzmán, Manolo Muñoz and Alberto Vásquez at the Auditorio Nacional with great success.
