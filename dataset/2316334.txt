Ermenigildo "Jilly" Rizzo (May 6, 1917 â€“ May 6, 1992) was an American restaurateur and entertainer.


== Career ==
As a young man, Rizzo worked with his father delivering Italian ice to cafes. Rizzo opened Jilly's Saloon, a lounge on West 49th Street, then moved to 256 West 52nd Street at the intersection with Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. Jilly's Saloon was a popular celebrity hangout in the 1960s. Rizzo's long-time friend Frank Sinatra frequented the lounge. Rizzo later became one of Sinatra's chief aides, and was even referenced in Sinatra's adapted lyrics for "Mrs. Robinson" to avoid using the name "Jesus". Rizzo was also a frequent guest on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, where he would recite one liners in his monotone New York accent.
In 1990, Rizzo and five other men were convicted of fraud in relation to an $8 million loan scheme. He was given 1,000 hours of community service.


== Death ==
On May 5, 1992, Jilly Rizzo had spent hours preparing for his birthday party, a soiree the next day that was to include his friend Frank Sinatra and other Rat Pack luminaries. A few minutes after midnight, he got into his car and headed for his girlfriend's house. After a few minutes, Rizzo was killed when his car was hit by businessman Jeffrey Perrotte.  He is buried in Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.
