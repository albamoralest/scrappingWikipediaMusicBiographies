=== Witham Hall ===
Lyons, who was a friend of the Banks family who owned Witham Hall, was appointed Headmaster of Witham Hall School in 1961, two years after the foundation of the school. Witham Hall flourished under Lyons's 29 year leadership, the number of pupils increasing from 20 at the time at which he started to 150 by the time he retired, in 1989, by which time the school had become a feeder school for Eton College, in addition to the local Oundle School, Uppingham School, and Oakham School. Under Lyons's leadership, the School developed a reputation for musical prowess; was inspected by the Ministry of Education and subsequently granted the status of an educational trust, in 1978; and began to admit girls, in 1983. There is a school house at Witham Hall, Lyons, named after Lyons, and a sports hall, at the time one of the largest in the country, was opened in 1987, and named the 'Lyons Hall', by the Governors of the school, in honour of Lyons. The Lyons Hall was demolished in 2016 to create space necessary for a larger sports centre.
