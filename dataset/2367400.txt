Over the next 22 years, the songwriting team wrote for Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Dean Martin, and many more.
Tepper and Bennett adjusted well to the advent of rock 'n roll. In 1961 their song "The Young Ones" was instrumental in boosting the career of Cliff Richard, for whom they wrote 21 compositions. They went on to write 43 songs for Elvis Presley, the most of any songwriter, or song writing team (all related to his movies).In the 1970s Tepper suffered a heart attack, which necessitated the end of his songwriting partnership with Bennett.
