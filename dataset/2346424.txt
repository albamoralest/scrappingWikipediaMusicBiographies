== Biography ==
From a very young age, Perales displayed an interest in music. At age 6, he learned to play the lute. At 16, Perales studied to be an electrical technician at the Universidad Laboral of Sevilla on a scholarship. During his time at university, he learned how to play the guitar and realized that music was going to form part of his life. After university, Perales moved to Madrid, where he completed his studies and continued his interest in music. His initial career as a musician was as a composer, because he did not like to sing and was unsure of the support of his girlfriend, Manuela. Encouraged by his mother, Mariana, Perales sang  at some local festivals in his hometown.
However, it was not until he met Rafael Trabucchelli (an influential Italian music producer in Spain at the time) in 1970 that his musical career took a dramatic turn. Trabucchelli discovered the young composer and talented, but reluctant, singer. 
Perales composed "Porque te vas", which was performed by Jeanette and sold 4 million copies worldwide in 1976. After much encouragement from Trabucchelli and his supporters, Perales decided to give singing a try.  His first record, "Celos de mi Guitarra" (Jealous of my Guitar) was a huge success in Spain and in Latin America. Although it was difficult for Perales to leave his job and devote himself to his new career, he was able to find a way to integrate his musical career into his life. He still lives in Castejón with his wife Manuela, son Pablo, and daughter Maria.
On 18 February 2019 he received the Medalla de Oro al Mérito en las Bellas Artes.
