Bobby Robinson (born Morgan Clyde Robinson; April 16, 1917 – January 7, 2011) was an American independent record producer and songwriter in New York City, most active from the 1950s through the mid-1980s.
Robinson produced hits by Wilbert Harrison, The Shirelles, Dave "Baby" Cortez, Elmore James, Lee Dorsey, Gladys Knight & The Pips, King Curtis, Spoonie Gee, Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, Doug E. Fresh, and Treacherous Three. He founded or co-founded Red Robin Records, Sue Records, Whirlin' Disc Records, Fury Records, Fire Records and Enjoy Records. Bobby Robinson's catalog is represented by Mojo Music & Media.


== Biography ==
Born in Union, South Carolina, Robinson served in the US Army in World War II. After the war, Robinson moved to New York City and opened "Bobby's Record Shop" (later "Bobby's Happy House") in 1946. There were only a few Black-owned businesses on 125th Street in Harlem during this period. Robinson's record shop became one of them.  Located on the corner of 125th St. and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.  His shop remained open until January 21, 2008, only being forced to close because the landlord planned to raze the building.
Robinson's store became a focal point for the independent record producers establishing themselves in New York.  During this time,  Robinson spent time assisting Ahmet Ertegun at Atlantic Records. He produced his first recording in 1951, "Bobby's Boogie" by saxophonist Morris Lane and his band.  Robinson normally specialised in recording vocal groups including the Mello-Moods, the Rainbows, the Vocaleers and the Du Droppers. He also recorded blues performers such as Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee
Robinson's first major success was "Shake Baby Shake" by Champion Jack Dupree in 1953. The record was released on Red Robin Records, which Robinson had established the previous year. The label was originally named Robin Records, but legal threats forced him to change it.Having enjoyed healthy local sales with doo-wop and blues discs in the early-to-mid-1950s, Robinson established several more record labels, some in partnership with his brother, Danny Robinson. Among them were Whirlin' Disc Records in 1956, Fury Records and Everlast Records in 1957, Sue Records with Juggy Murray in 1957, Fire Records in 1959, and Enjoy Records in 1962. He launched Fire and Fury as vehicles for rhythm and blues and rock and roll artists, most of which were produced by him in New York City, but some were produced by others and acquired by him in various Southern cities.
Robinson produced top-selling records by Wilbert Harrison, The Shirelles, Lee Dorsey, and Dave "Baby" Cortez, many of whom were signed to the label by A&R man Marshall Sehorn. One of his earliest hits was Harrison's "Kansas City", over which he faced legal action brought by Herman Lubinsky of Savoy Records, who claimed he had Harrison under contract. Robinson produced Gladys Knight & the Pips' first hit, "Every Beat of My Heart" (after he signed them to Fury; the original version was recorded in Atlanta, issued locally on Huntom and leased to Vee Jay, who had the bigger hit). Robinson produced several Elmore James records as well as recordings by Lightnin' Hopkins, Arthur Crudup, and Buster Brown. King Curtis's "Soul Twist" was the first release of his Enjoy label in 1962, and over twenty years later, he released the hit, "I’m The Packman (Eat Everything I Can)" by The Packman, on the same label. The rights to Robinson's recordings on Fire and Fury were sold to Bell Records in 1965.
Compilation album producer Diana Reid Haig wrote:The common thread that connected all of Robinson's various record labels was his uncanny ability to bring out the best in his artists. While most producers at that time attempted to soften the edges of rhythm & blues singers in hopes of appealing to the pop market, Robinson delighted in capturing raw-edged artists like Elmore James and Buster Brown just as they were.
In the 1970s, Robinson produced some of the first hip-hop music records for his "Enjoy" label . In 1979, he recorded Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five's first record, "Superrappin'", an innovative record which was influential in hip-hop's early years. A local hit in New York, the record failed to hit nationwide.  Robinson then produced records by Pumpkin and Friends, the Funky Four Plus One More, Spoonie Gee (Robinson's nephew), and Kool Moe Dee with the Treacherous Three.  He produced Doug E. Fresh's "Just Having Fun (Do The Beatbox)", which introduced beatboxing to the record-buying public.Robinson died on January 7, 2011 at the age of 93, after a period of declining health.
