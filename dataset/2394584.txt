His 1980 film Sällskapsresan entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival.As an artist, he is famous for making various lithographs; one of his stocks in trade are sketchy Mickey Mouse drawings. He is a member of Svenska Serieakademien. He also re-designed the seat textiles for the Stockholm Metro subway in the 1990s.
As a musician, he played in the nationally successful band Electric Banana Band. Åberg is also the creator of Trazan & Banarne, one of the most beloved Swedish children's shows ever. It was shown on Sveriges Television in the late 1970s/early 1980s. The characters of the show, Trazan Apansson (Åberg) and Banarne (Klasse Möllberg) are also members of the Electric Banana Band.
