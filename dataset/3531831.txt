== The RAH Band ==
Hewson founded The RAH Band – of which he was the sole member and which took its name from his initials – in 1977 – to release an instrumental called "The Crunch". The piece climbed to number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. The song also peaked at number 16 in Australia. Hewson played all the musical instruments himself. The arrangement involved the use of no synthesisers, only conventional guitar and keyboards with pedal effects. He was later featured on Top of the Pops. A number of jazz funk releases followed.  The second big hit single for the RAH Band was in 1985 when the soul ballad, "Clouds Across the Moon", also reached number 6 in the UK chart. Vocals were provided by his wife Liz, also known as "Dizzy Lizzy".
In July 2007, Hewson released a remixed "Clouds Across the Moon '07", which featured vocalist Emma Charles.The RAH band's releases were issued under a variety of record labels, including Good Earth Records, DJM, KR Records, TMT Records and RCA.
