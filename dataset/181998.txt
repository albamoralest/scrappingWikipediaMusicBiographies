== Popular culture ==
Remick was the subject of "Lee Remick", the 1978 debut single by the Australian indie rock band The Go-Betweens. For some reason, songwriter Robert Forster thought Remick was from Ireland, and references this in the song. In reality, Remick was American-born and raised (as were her parents); after 1970, she divided her time between England and the US. 
The British indie rock band Hefner recorded a song titled "Lee Remick" in 1998, unrelated to the Go-Betweens' single.
