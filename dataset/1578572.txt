Samuel Gooden (born September 2, 1934) is an American soul singer. He is best known for being an original member of the successful group The Impressions from its beginnings as The Roosters in the 1950s.Though often uncredited, his smooth voice can often be heard trading lines with lead singer Curtis Mayfield (most notably on "It's All Right") or his replacement, Leroy Hutson, on quite a number of songs. Gooden also sang lead vocals on a handful of Impressions tunes, such as "Aware Of Love" and the group's cover of "I Wanna Be Around". Gooden and the group are still recording and performing. He was inducted with the group in 1991 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.He can be seen with original Impressions members Fred Cash and the late Curtis Mayfield (via archive footage) in the group's first-ever extended interview in the 2008 DVD Movin On Up â€“ The Message and The Music of Curtis Mayfield & The Impressions, which also features a special poem dedicated to the group written and performed by actor Clifton Davis.
