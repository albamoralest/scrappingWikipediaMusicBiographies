Robert Cabot Sherman Jr. (born July 22, 1943) is an American singer, actor and occasional songwriter who became a teen idol in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He had a series of successful singles, notably the million-seller "Little Woman" (1969). Sherman retreated from his show business career in the 1970s for a career as an EMT and a deputy sheriff, though he occasionally performed into the 1990s.


== Entertainment career ==


=== Music ===
In 1962, Sal Mineo wrote two songs for Sherman as well as arranging for Sherman to record the songs. In 1964, when Mineo asked Sherman to sing with his old band at a Hollywood party (where many actors and agents were in attendance), Sherman was signed with an agent and eventually landed a part on the ABC television show Shindig! as a regular cast member/house singer.Sherman made several records with Decca and another smaller label and was featured in teen magazines. In early 1968, he was selected for the role of the bashful, stammering logger, Jeremy Bolt, in the ABC television series Here Come the Brides (1968-1970). As of 1970, Bobby Sherman had received more fan mail than any other performer on the ABC-TV network.Sherman appeared on an episode of Honey West entitled "The Princess and the Paupers" as a kidnapped band member and an episode of The Monkees entitled "Monkees at the Movies", playing a pompous surfer/singer named Frankie Catalina in the vein of Frankie Avalon, performing the song "The New Girl in School" (the flip of Jan & Dean's "Dead Man's Curve").
Sherman released 107 songs, 23 singles and 10 albums between 1962 and 1976. In his recording career, he earned seven gold singles, one platinum single, and five gold albums. He had a career total of seven top 40 hits. In 1969, he signed with Metromedia Records. In May 1969, he released the single "Little Woman", which peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#2 in Canada) and spent nine weeks in the Top 20. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in October 1969.His other hits were "Julie, Do Ya Love Me" (US #5/AC #2) (Canada #3) (Australia #3) (written by Tom Bahler), "Easy Come, Easy Go" (US #9/AC #2) (Canada #6), "Jennifer" (US #60/AC #9) (Canada #32), "La La La (If I Had You)" (US #9/AC #14) (Canada #7), and "The Drum" (US #29/AC #2) (Canada #7) (written by Alan O'Day). Some of these songs were produced by Jackie Mills, a Hollywood record producer, who also produced the Brady Bunch Kids. In Canada, "Hey, Mister Sun" reached #19, "Cried Like a Baby" reached #10, and "Waiting At The Bus Stop" reached #31. "La, La, La," "Easy Come, Easy Go," and "Julie, Do Ya Love Me" all sold in excess of a million copies and garnered further gold discs for Sherman. "Julie, Do Ya Love Me" was Sherman's sole excursion in the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at #28 in November 1970. The song competed there for chart space with White Plains' cover version, which eventually placed higher at #8.Sherman toured extensively through the United States and the world in support of his records and albums.  He gave many concerts to sellout crowds of mostly screaming young women from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s.  The screaming of the young women was so loud that Sherman experienced hearing loss.


=== Television ===
Sherman was a regular star on the weekly ABC television network show Here Come the Brides on from September 25, 1968 to April 3, 1970.  The series was loosely based upon the Mercer Girls project, Asa Mercer's efforts to bring civilization to old Seattle in the 1860s by importing marriageable women from the east coast cities of the United States, where the ravages of the American Civil War left those towns short of men.  Bobby Sherman played the youngest brother, Jeremy Bolt.
Sherman was a frequent guest on American Bandstand and Where the Action Is. A March 1971 episode of The Partridge Family featured Sherman, serving as a back-door pilot for the ABC TV series Getting Together, which aired starting in September 1971. The show was canceled after 14 episodes.
Sherman was a guest star on television series such as Emergency!, The F.B.I., The Mod Squad, Ellery Queen, Murder She Wrote and Frasier. He has also been a guest on The Ed Sullivan Show, American Bandstand, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, KTLA Morning News, Visiting with Huell Howser on PBS, Good Day LA, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Good Morning America, and The Tonight Show with both Johnny Carson and later Jay Leno.  He was featured on 20/20, VH1, Entertainment Tonight, and Extra, among other television shows. 
Sherman was a regular cast member on the television show Sanchez of Bel Air in 1986.
