Félix-Auguste Duvert (12 January 1795 – 19 October 1876) was a 19th-century French playwright and vaudevillist.


== Biography ==
Félix-Auguste Duvert was first a soldier. A volunteer in 1811 among the riflemen of the young guard, he then was part of a regiment of dragoons that he left only after the dismissal of the Armée de la Loire.
In 1823, he made his debut as a playwright at the Théâtre du Gymnase dramatique with Les Frères de lait, a one-act comédie en vaudeville cowritten with Édouard Nicole. He would afterwards collaborate primarily with Paul Duport, Saintine, Étienne Arago, Charles Dupeuty and Charles Varin. But from 1830, his name was inseparably linked to that of his son in law, Augustin de Lauzanne. The latter's share in the development of their works was the backbone of the plot, the outlining of the characters and imagination of the quiproquos. The duo would produce a very great number of successful "follies" for over forty years.
Duvert also wrote the lyrics of many songs. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery (54th division).
