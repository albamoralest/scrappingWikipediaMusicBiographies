Peter Lipa (born May 30, 1943) is a Slovak singer, composer, and promoter of jazz. He has been called the Father of Slovak Jazz.Peter Lipa (1943) is regarded as the most significant figure in the Slovak jazz scene. He developed a unique vocal style that focused on the lyrics. His music is influenced by performers along with Jimmy Rushing, Ray Charles, Al Jarreau, Joe Cocker, and Bobby McFerrin, and is a mix of jazz and blues. He was the first jazz singer to use Slovak.


== Life and career ==
Lipa was born in Prešov to Hungarian parents and has worked in Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. His roots are in blues, soul, and classical music and his work rock and jazz standards.
In 2003, he released an album called Beatles in Blue(s) with versions of sixteen songs by The Beatles. He and his arrangers and musicians intended to create the most unusual renditions they could imagine. Some songs, such as "Every Little Thing" and "I Wanna Be Your Man", are recorded so differently from the original versions that only the lyrics remain. In each case, the tempo, rhythm, chord changes, and melody are new.
Three of his studio albums have been listed among The 100 Greatest Slovak Albums of All Time, such as Lipa spieva Lasicu (2005), at number fifty-eight, ...v najlepších rokoch (2001), at number sixty-three, and Naspäť na stromy (1995), at number eighty-one. His album 68 (2012) peaked at number forty-eight on the Czech Albums Chart.
