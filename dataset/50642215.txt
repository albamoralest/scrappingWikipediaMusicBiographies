Félix Baumaine, full name Félix Gratien Baumaine, (4 December 1828 – 3 January 1881) was a 19th-century French playwright, composer and chansonnier.
The son of Joseph Baumaine, director of the shows in the city of Reims, Felix Baumaine is known for his collaboration with Charles Blondelet with whom he composed many songs played especially in cafés-concerts. He was thus himself the author of 1300 songs. During the last years of his life, Félix Baumaine was administrator of the café-concert des Ambassadeurs. He was the father of actress Juliette Baumaine.
