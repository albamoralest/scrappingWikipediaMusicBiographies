Rashid Behbudov (Azerbaijani: Rəşid Məcid oğlu Behbudov; 14 December 1915 – 9 June 1989) was a Soviet and Azerbaijani singer and actor.
Rashid Behbudov was born in Tbilisi in 1915. His father, Majid Behbudov, was a singer as well. In 1945, upon the invitation of Tofig Guliyev, Rashid Behbudov moved to Baku. In the same year, he was assigned the main role of Asgar in the film Arshin Mal Alan (The Cloth Peddler), based on a play by Uzeyir Hajibeyov. His role in this film combined with his vocal skills brought him fame throughout Azerbaijan.
In a short time, Behbudov became also prominent Azerbaijani pop singer. His combination of vocal masterpieces ranged from classical performances to lyrical songs. Behbudov's rare vocal talent gave him opportunity to travel beyond the "Iron Curtain" of the Soviet Union, and as a singer he toured with concert performances in several countries of the world, including Iran, Turkey, China, India, Japan, Argentina, and many other countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America.
In 1966, he created the State Song Theater, which still carries his name, and became its soloist and artistic manager.
