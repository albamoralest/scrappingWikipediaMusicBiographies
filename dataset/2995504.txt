Laurence Earl Crosby (January 3, 1895 – February 7, 1975) was the longtime publicity director of his younger brother, Bing Crosby. He was the eldest of Bing's six siblings.
The seven Crosby children were the four elder brothers Larry, Everett (1896–1966), Ted (1900–1973), and Bing (1903–1977), two sisters Catherine (1905–1974) and Mary Rose (1907–1990), and the youngest sibling, brother Bob (1913-1993). His parents were English-American bookkeeper Harry Lillis Crosby Sr. (1871–1950) and Irish-American Catherine Helen "Kate" Harrigan (1873–1964), daughter of a builder from County Cork, Ireland.
Crosby managed the annual Bing Crosby National Pro-Amateur (also called the Crosby Clambake; today known as the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) at Pebble Beach, California, near Monterey.
Starting in 1971, he was also the director of "Prisoners in Exchange for American Construction Enterprise (PEACE)", a group seeking better treatment of prisoners of war taken during the Vietnam War.
Crosby died of cancer in the Century City area of Los Angeles on February 7, 1975, at the age of 80.
