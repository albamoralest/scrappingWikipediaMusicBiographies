M. Pierre Henri [sic] Martin called Lubize has just died at the age of 61. This playwright, born in Bayonne, held a very important place among the producers of our time. Alternately collaborator of MM. Léonce, Théaulon, Cogniard brothers, Grangé, Guinot, Labiche, Siraudin, Brisebarre, Paul de Kock, Varin, Michel Delaporte, etc., etc., he mingled his name to theirs in the signing of a large number of comedies, many of which were a great success, including the Conseil de discipline, Une assemblée de créanciers, le Muet de Saint-Malo, la Tasse cassée, le Misanthrope et l'Auvergnat, Obliger est si doux, le Spectacle à la Cour.
Mr. Lubize without collaborators has not been less successful: the Cinquantaine and Latude would suffice to prove it.
