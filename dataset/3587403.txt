Adelaida Fernando-Villegas (born Adelaida Marquez Fernando; March 17, 1914 – August 30, 2004), better known as Dely Atay-Atayan or Adelaida Fernando, was a Filipina comedienne and singer. Her career in entertainment spanned seven decades, beginning in bodabil and ending in television.


== Biography ==
Atay-Atayan was born in Tondo, Manila. One of her younger brothers, Ading Fernando, would grow up to be a prominent television comedian and director.Atay-Atayan had completed her second year in high school when she broke into showbusiness as a kundiman singer at the Palace Theater in Manila. From 1930 to 1934, she toured with a bodabil troupe, billing herself as "The Queen of Laughs". She made her film debut in 1940 with Lakambini, where she played opposite her husband, comedian Andoy Balunbalunan. After Balunbalunan's death, she married Catalino Ong.


== Career ==
From 1940 until 1994, Atay-Atayan appeared in over 300 films. She was also a popular comedian on radio, starring in programs such as Tangtarang-Tang. She formed a comedic quartet with Pugak, Lopito and Doro de los Ojos, calling themselves "Ancient Fox".Her most famous role was as Doña Delilah, the wealthy, imperious and disapproving mother-in-law of John Puruntong (Dolphy) in the RPN sitcom John en Marsha, which was created by her brother Ading and ran for seventeen years. Her portrayal proved as the definitive "mother-in-law" archetype in Filipino popular culture. Her famous tag-line, uttered without fail in every episode to John Puruntong, was a scathing admonition: "Magsumikap ka!" ("Strive harder!") She also popularized the Filipino catch-phrase "Hudas! Barabas! Hestas!" in this sitcom.
She had another famous role as the mother of Vic Ungassis (played by Vic Sotto) in a sitcom of Iskul Bukol. Her character came from the town of Tiaong, Quezon and popularized the term of endearment "Bunsoy!" for addressing Vic. The root word "bunso" is Tagalog for youngest child.
Her last movie was Chick Boy in 1994 following her retirement in the same year.
