Dafydd Iwan Jones (born 24 August 1943) is a Welsh singer and nationalist politician who rose to fame writing and performing folk music in the Welsh language. From 2003 to 2010, Iwan was the president of Plaid Cymru, a political party which advocates for Welsh independence from the UK.


== Early life ==
Dafydd Iwan Jones was born in Brynamman, Carmarthenshire. One of four boys, his siblings include actor Huw Ceredig and politician Alun Ffred Jones. His paternal grandfather, Fred Jones, was a member of the Bardic family Teulu'r Cilie, and a founding member of Plaid Cymru. He spent most of his youth in Bala in Gwynedd before attending the University of Wales, Cardiff where he studied architecture.


== Musical career ==
Iwan's earliest material was Welsh translations of songs by American folk/protest singers: Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Bob Dylan until he began to write his first ballads. The most prominent of these were political including the satirical song, "Carlo" ("Charles"). This was written for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. Iwan has also written love ballads and variations on traditional Welsh folk tunes.By the late 1960s, he was receiving television coverage both for his music and for his political activities. He was imprisoned in 1970 for refusal to pay fines for defacing English language road signs as part of the fight for Welsh language rights as a member of Cymdeithas yr Iaith, serving three weeks of a three-month sentence. This event was commemorated in his song "Pam fod eira'n wyn?" ("Why is Snow White?"). His song "Peintio'r byd yn wyrdd"' ("Painting the World Green") was regarded as a "battle hymn" of the road signs campaign.During the 1970s, his political interests (and songs) took in such themes as Pinochet's Chile; Welsh Devolution; the Vietnam War and the Northern Ireland troubles. Later songs mention events such as the Tiananmen Square massacre (1989), the Gulf War (1990) and opencast mining in the south Wales valleys (1995). "Yma O Hyd" ("Still Here") was released in 1981.
In 1982 and 1983, Iwan embarked on two tours (and accompanying records) with the folk group Ar Log.
Around the turn of the millennium, he signalled an end to regular performances, although he remains an occasional performer.
In January 2020, Iwan's song "Yma o Hyd" ("Still Here") reached number one in the UK iTunes chart, spurred on by purchases by supporters of Welsh independence group YesCymru. The campaign mirrored the success of the Wolfe Tones song "Come Out, Ye Black and Tans" earlier that month.


== Public life ==
Using his architecture studies, in 1971 Iwan was one of the founders of Cymdeithas Tai Gwynedd (Gwynedd Housing Association) and was involved in other projects to provide homes for the local population in north-west Wales.Dafydd Iwan was one of the founders of Recordiau Sain Cyf (Sain Records Ltd), one of the main Welsh music labels.Formerly a Plaid Cymru councillor in Gwynedd he lost his seat in the May 2008 local elections. He blamed his defeat on a dirty tricks campaign by his opponents.Iwan's long service to the Welsh language led to his being made an honorary member of the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod at Bangor in 1971.Iwan escaped a driving ban (for speeding offences) in October 2003 on the basis that he needed to drive for his musical and political duties.Iwan became President of Plaid Cymru in 2003.As part of his campaign seeking re-election as President of Plaid Cymru, Iwan launched a campaign blog 'Dafydd 4 President' in July 2008.On 22 October 2011, Dafydd and his wife Bethan came to watch the Welsh derby, Wrexham FC vs Newport County AFC. Dafydd sang his hit song "Yma O Hyd" in front of a crowd of 4,000 before the teams came out. He was invited to sing by the new Wrexham FC Supporters Group, who chose their name 'Yma O Hyd' after his song.
