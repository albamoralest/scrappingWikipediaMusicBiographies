Pierre-Louis Hus-Desforges (24 March 1773 – 20 January 1838) was a French cellist, conductor and composer. He is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Pierre-Louis Hus-Desforges Jarnowick".The grandson of theatre manager Barthélemy Hus-Desforges, he came from a long line of entertainers, the Hus family, and his grandmother was a Courtenay.
After he finished his studies at the Conservatoire de Paris with Benoit Tranquille Berbiguier, he began as a cellist in various orchestras. In the early nineteenth century, he was conductor at St. Petersburg, returned to Paris, then taught in Metz from 1819 to 1822.
