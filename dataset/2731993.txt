== Early life ==
Sérgio Godinho was born in Porto on 31 August 1945. He bought his first acoustic guitar when he was 15 years-old.He lived in Porto during his youth. He started by studying Economics in university, by recommendation from his father, but decided to quit on his second year. At the age of 20, he decided to leave Portugal, motivated by a desire of emancipation and also to avoid the conscription for the Portuguese Colonial War. He went to study Psychology in Geneva, where he had Jean Piaget as one of his professors. After two years, in 1967, still unsatisfied with the path chosen, Godinho left the course and decided to dedicate himself to the arts.In the following months, Godinho traveled across different places in France, Italy and the Netherlands. He then moved to Paris, where he worked as a stage actor, being cast for the French version of the musical Hair, and started writing songs. In Paris, he befriended José Mário Branco, a fellow Portuguese songwriter, who is nowadays also regarded as one of the greatest singer-songwriters of música de intervenção. He also there met his first wife, Sheila, while working on Hair. He was living in Paris during the May 68 protests.After his first recordings in 1971, he did more travels in the Netherlands, Canada and Brazil. In Brazil, he joined the theater group Living Theatre, and was arrested for two and a half months after taking part in a protest show in Minas Gerais. He returned to Paris to perform in another season of Hair and then moved to the Netherlands for a short time.Godinho lived in Canada, specifically in Montreal and Vancouver, from 1972 to 1974, with his partner Sheila. He returned to Portugal in September 1974, some months after the Carnation Revolution in Portugal.


== Music career ==


=== 1971-1974: The exile years ===
Sérgio Godinho started his music career in Paris, composing and recording with José Mário Branco in 1971. Both Godinho and Branco's first albums were recorded at the same time, at the Strawberry Studio in Château d'Hérouville. Godinho wrote the lyrics to four tracks in Branco's first album, Mudam-se os Tempos, Mudam-se as Vontades, released that same year. Branco produced and played in Godinho's first EP and first album.
Godinho's first release was the EP Romance de um Dia na Estrada in 1971.

He recorded his second album Pré-Histórias in 1972, and it was likewise released in the following year in Portugal.
Because of the political messages in some of its lyrics, Os Sobreviventes and Pré-Historias were targeted by the censorship of the Estado Novo regime, at a time in which the censorship from Marcelo Caetano's administration paradoxically wished to become softer but also more controlling of pop music that criticized the regime. Os Sobreviventes was removed from stores several times.Godinho was living in Canada when the Carnation Revolution happened in Portugal. He started the recording of his third album in Canada and later finished it in Portugal.
