She earned a bachelor's degree in 1916 and a master's degree in 1932 at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. She continued her studies with support from a Rosenwald Fellowship. Her master's thesis at Oberlin was titled "Afro-Creole Music in Louisiana: A Thesis on the Plantation Songs Created by the Creole Negroes of Louisiana."She made further studies on a sabbatical in 1939 and 1940, at Columbia University and the Juilliard School.

She was a featured performer in the Negro Exhibits Building at the Texas Centennial Exposition in 1936. She toured France as a cultural relations representative in 1954, sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency (USIA); her success on radio and stage in France was helped by her fluent French.From 1935 to 1938, Nickerson was president of the National Association of Negro Musicians.

Some of her arrangements were published as Five Creole Songs Harmonized and Arranged by Camille Nickerson (1942).
