John Mortimer, born in Clare, Suffolk, (2 July 1931 â€“ 2 September 1992) professionally Johnnie Mortimer, was a British scriptwriter for British TV whose work, along with creative writing partner Brian Cooke, also served as inspiration for American television projects.


== Life and career ==
He started out as a cartoonist, which brought him into contact with his writing partner Brian Cooke. Mortimer later wrote series for radio such as Men from the Ministry and Round the Horne, before writing many TV situation comedies including Foreign Affairs, Father Dear Father, Man About the House, Never the Twain, Robin's Nest and George and Mildred, often working in partnership with Brian Cooke. A version of Man about the House later transferred to America under the name Three's Company.
The partnership also wrote two plays, the first a theatrical version of George and Mildred (later renamed When the Cat's Away after the death of actress Yootha Joyce who played Mildred). The second was Situation Comedy, and featured two TV situation comedy writers struggling to come up with an idea for a new series (in the end they write a stage play instead).
