Mysore Ananthaswamy (ಮೈಸೂರು ಅನಂತಸ್ವಾಮಿ) was one of the pioneers of Kannada Bhavageethe in Karnataka. He was a very popular  composer and singer of Kannada Sugama Sangeetha. He composed music for several poems and bhavageethe written by well-known Kannada poets like Kuvempu, K. S. Nissar Ahmed, N S Lakshminarayana Bhatta, etc., and popularized them throughout the globe. Some of his most famous songs include: Jogada Siri Belakinali, Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate, O Nanna Chetana and Ede Tumbi Haadidenu. Ananthaswamy played Mandolin in his early days which he purchased for 25 rupees. Later, he switched to Harmonium as there was a difficulty in fine tuning Mandolin.Ananthaswamy composed music to the state anthem of Karnataka, Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate in 1960. He once sang his composition in front of Kuvempu who is the writer of the anthem at Maharaja College in Mysore. A note in Ananthaswamy's diary says Kuvempu was delighted by his tune and approved his tune, adding a suggestion that it should be sung in a group. Several committees have recommended the tune composed by Ananthaswamy to be recognized as the official tune of the Karnataka state anthem.
