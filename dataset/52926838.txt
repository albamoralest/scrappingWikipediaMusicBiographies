Arthur Hoérée (16 April 1897, Brussels – 2 June 1986, Paris) was a Belgian musicologist, critic, conductor and composer.
He studied at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels from 1908 to 1912, then at the Conservatoire de Paris.
He was a lecturer and a professor at the École normale de musique, École de la radio à Montrouge and the Sorbonne University. 
He wrote music reviews in many French periodicals including the prestigious and famous La Revue Musicale of Henry Prunières.
A specialist in French music, Hoérée has transcribed and produced several works by François Couperin, and he has published two monographs on Albert Roussel (Paris, 1938, 1969).
His activities as a composer extend to film and stage music. He often collaborated with Arthur Honegger. He had the composer and organist André Jorrand as student in his course of instrumentation.
