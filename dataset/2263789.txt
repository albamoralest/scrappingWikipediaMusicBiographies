== Career ==

Prior to Uganda's independence, three sub-committees were established to deal with creating Uganda’s national symbols. The sub-committee for the creation of a national anthem encouraged Ugandans to submit their proposals.

"The compositions had to be short, original, solemn, praising and looking forward to the future. They had to be harmonised in the usual four parts-soprano, alto, tenor and bass," said Kakoma in an interview.In July 1962, the committee chose Kakoma's composition. It had taken him a day to compose the music and write the lyrics for "Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty".
Kakoma worked as a music teacher in the Masaka District.
