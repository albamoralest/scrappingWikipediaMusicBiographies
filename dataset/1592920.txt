Born in Westboro, a suburb of Ottawa, Lawrence was the daughter of George Frederick Francis Lawrence, a carpenter, and Annie Louise Hagar, who moved from Ramsgate, England to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1910. George Lawrence found work as a streetcar operator, then as a home builder.
The family moved to Boston in 1922, then moved to California. In 1925, a fall on a school playground in Los Angeles resulted in paralysis on her left side. Dancing (suggested by a doctor as therapy for her weakened left leg and side) led to professional engagements.Lawrence was one of the first women to swim Lake Tahoe in Nevada.
