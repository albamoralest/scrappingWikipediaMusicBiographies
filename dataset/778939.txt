During the Second World War, he joined the USO where he toured battle fronts and made his London debut performing with Bob Hope. After the war, he continued to work in vaudeville and as master of ceremonies for the swing orchestras of Freddy Martin and Charlie Barnet.Directors viewed Kaye as a master of the Broadway idiom, evidenced by his introduction of three show-stopping numbers of the era:  "Fugue for Tinhorns" and "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat"  from Guys and Dolls (1950) and  "Jubilation T.
