Graham Salisbury (born April 11, 1944) is an American children's writer. His best known work is Under the Blood Red Sun, a historical novel that features a Japanese-American boy and his family during World War II. Under the name Sandy Salisbury he was a pop musician in the late 1960s, notably with The Millennium.


== Biography ==
Salisbury was born in Philadelphia. He grew up in Hawaii and lived in Kailua, Oahu. Later he attended Hawaii Preparatory Academy in Kamuela, Hawaii.
Salisbury was a songwriter and musician in the late 1960s and is best known for his association with Curt Boettcher. He was a member of Boettcher's groups The Millennium and The Ballroom (whose 1966 album remained unreleased until 2001), before attempting a solo career of his own, with Boettcher producing, on Gary Usher's Together Records label.
He performed on many hit recordings from bands such as The Association, Paul Revere and The Raiders, Tommy Roe and many others.
On The Millennium's only album, Begin, he played guitar, sung and contributed one self-penned song, 5 A.M.
Though an album and several singles were released, the unprecedented expense of the recording of Begin may have contributed to CBS Records souring on the project. The album met with tepid sales and disappeared for many years before it was rediscovered by Sunshine Pop enthusiasts and grew to become a cult classic.
In 1975-76, "Sandy" was in Bergamo, Italy studying Montessori Elementary education.  He participated in the congregation of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and spoke in Italian to his friends there.  At the final exam, he became nervous over a question and the examiner asked him what he'd rather do.  Not thinking that a different question/demonstration was being offered him, he responded he'd rather be playing his guitar.  He returned to Utah and married.
In the early 2000s, compilations of his work started appearing, including the release of his late 1960s solo album.
Salisbury worked several jobs before writing children's fiction (under his given name).
In 2014, a movie was made of his historical novel 'Under the Blood Red Sun'.He lives with his family in Lake Oswego, Oregon.
