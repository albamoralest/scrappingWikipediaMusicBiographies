Charles Casimir Manry (8 February 1823 – 18 January 1866) was a French composer and choral conductor.


== Life ==
Charles Manry was the son of Jean Manry, a physician at the hôpital Saint-Louis in Paris and a member of the Académie de médecine.
He first studied law and took his legal argument but his fortune enabled him to indulge in his penchant for music. He then studied harmony and counterpoint with Antoine Elwart.
