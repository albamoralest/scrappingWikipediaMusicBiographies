This group (under the name of "V. Monti") written several pieces and techniques for mandolin students, and started performances in 1908 to 1910. In 1910, Monti created a music journal called Le Mediator, the journal gave news and instructional guidance to help new mandolin and guitar players. However, this journal dissolved in 1913.
