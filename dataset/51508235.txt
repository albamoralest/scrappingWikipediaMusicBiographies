She wrote the tango "La piba de mano a mano" (one of the tracks on this album) together with Tití Rossi.Apart from her recordings and a few short tours in Argentina and neighboring countries, the bulk of her singing career was on radio.

Larrauri joined a group of women that, led by Eva Perón, pushed the passing of the law giving women the right to vote, approved in 1947.Larrauri joined the National Committee of Eva Perón's Women's Peronist Party (Partido Peronista Femenino, or PPF) as the representative of Entre Ríos Province. Other members were Águeda Barro, Dora Gaeta, María Rosa Calviño, Amparo Pérez, and Delia Parodi.In 1951 Larrauri was elected by the provincial legislature of Entre Ríos Province as one of its National Senators, joining a group of the first women to be elected to the Senate. That same year Larrauri sang "Evita Capitana", which became the anthem of the Women's Peronist Party. In 1952 she became the president of the Commission for the Eva Perón Monument.She was deposed along with all the other elected representatives by a right-wing military coup (the Revolución Libertadora) on 16 September 1955, and was imprisoned by the resulting military dictatorship of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu.During the ban of Peronism (1955–1972) Larrauri became a major leader in the women's branch of the movement known as the "Peronist Resistance". When the ban on the Justicialist Party (Partido Justicialista) was lifted in 1972, she was a member of its Consejo Superior, representing the women's branch of the Peronist movement, which, at its core, took a position in opposition to Jorge Daniel Paladino. In 1972 she was part of the delegation which accompanied Juan Perón on his return to Argentina.In 1973 she was re-elected as a national senator, and on 24 March 1976 was again deposed along with the other elected representatives when a right-wing military dictatorship under Jorge Rafael Videla overthrew Isabel Martínez de Perón in a coup d'état.
