== Biography ==
Harvey Pittell began his musical education in at the age of 7 at Clifford Street Elementary School in Los Angeles California.  Pittel Pursued his undergraduate degree in Music Education at the University of Southern California. He perused his Master of Music degree in Saxophone Performance under the tutelage of Fred Hemke at Northwestern University. 
During the Vietnam War Pittel Enlisted in The Navy and performed with the West Point Military Academy Band. During this time he began further studies with Joe Allard of the Juilliard School. Just after leaving the West Point Band, Pittel won the Concert Artists Guild Competition and through this made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1971 playing to such acclamation he was re-presented by the same organization in 1973.
When Pittel's tour of duty was over he accepted a position as the saxophone teacher at USC. He also teaches at Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Long Beach, Cal State San Diego, East Los Angeles Junior College, and The University of Texas at Austin. He also tours with Harvey Pittel Duo, the Harvey Pittel Trio, and the Harvey Pittel Saxophone Quartet.
Along the way Pittel has been featured on a number of movie soundtracks, including Manhattan for Woody Allen, appeared as a guest on The Today Show - seriously how many saxophonists can list that on their resume - and been featured on Live From Lincoln Center. He has received numerous other awards including two Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund grants, and a National Endowment for the Arts Solo Recitalist grant. To be fair and honest, all of the accolades listed above still leave so many equally stunning achievements out. A funny and warm individual, this kind of a litany of accomplishments would, for us mere mortals, be the work of three lifetimes, but for Pittel, who is still young, one knows for sure it's only the beginning.
