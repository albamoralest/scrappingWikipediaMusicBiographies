John Garvey (March 17, 1921
- July 18, 2006) was an American musician, orchestra leader, and academic who played viola in the Walden String Quartet for 23 seasons, introduced a jazz curriculum at the University of Illinois, and created its Jazz Big Band which he led until his retirement from the university in 1991. The jazz band dominated collegiate jazz festival awards in its early days and in 1969 was chosen by the state department to tour the USSR and Eastern Europe. Many members of Garvey's jazz bands went on to successful careers as professional musicians and academics.


== Early years ==
Inspired by a talk given by the violinist of the Chautauqua Trio, Garvey began studying violin at age 7. By 14 he was commuting from his home in Reading, PA every other week to Temple University in Philadelphia to study violin with Alfred Lorenz,
a violist with the Philadelphia Orchestra
He went on to major in music at Temple.


== As a Jobbing Musician ==
After college Garvey played with the Philadelphia Symphony and Columbus Philharmonic. In March 1943, Garvey joined a dance band that played pop-styled classical music led by a classically trained violinist named Jan Savitt, "The Stokowski of Swing".
In the summer of 1948 he was director of the summer chamber music program at Ball State University.


== Academia ==
In 1948, Garvey joined the Walden String Quartet in an until-then frequently changing viola chair. He was to remain with the quartet until 1971. The group had recently become quartet-in-residence at the University of Illinois.
In addition to touring and recording, the Quartet were members of the music faculty. Garvey was hired as Instructor in the department and within a few years was promoted to Assistant Professor. In May 1952, Garvey became head of the music committee of the university’s Festival of Contemporary Arts.
In 1959, he was made a full professor.


== The University Jazz Program ==
Work with Harry Partch on "The Bewitched", a music and dance piece for the 1957 festival, rekindled Garvey's interest in jazz,: 281 
and for the 1959 festival he invited the Modern Jazz Quartet to play with a student jazz band and a string ensemble.: 281 Because of student interest in continuing the jazz band, Garvey sought funding from the School of Music, but faced strong opposition. By October 1960 he was able to get $150 from the school, and obtained additional money and administrative support from the student union.
Garvey and the band made their debut at a routine Thursday morning School of Music function on December 8, 1960.: 283  In April 1964, they entered the Collegiate Jazz Festival at Notre Dame University
for the first time and took the prize for Best Big Band.
In 1965 and 1966, they were finalists at the festival.
and in March 1967, the band won Best Overall Jazz Group.
In December 1967, Garvey's band was officially sanctioned by the School of Music.: 285 In 1968, and 1969 they again won "Best Overall Jazz Group", the first ensemble to do so three years in a row. The prize at the 1968 and 1969 festivals was an invitation to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival, for which they received praise from critics Leonard Feather and John S. Wilson.The 1969 Downbeat Readers Poll ranked the band 16th place in the jazz Big Band category, the only college band in the entire poll.: 285 The accolades led to sponsorship by the US State Department for an eight-week tour of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia in 1968

, and a six-week tour of the Soviet Union in 1969.By 1970 the School of Music was sponsor of four jazz bands.: 285 Many alumni of Garvey's bands went on to successful careers as musicians and teachers, including Cecil Bridgewater, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Jim McNeely, Ron Dewar, Joel Helleny, and Howie Smith.


== The Russian Folk Orchestra ==
During the tour of the U.S.S.R., Garvey became interested in Russian folk music. Upon returning he found funds through the university to purchase 25 balalaikas, and in 1973 formed the Russian Balalaika Orchestra
, soon to be renamed the Russian Folk Orchestra. Garvey led this ensemble for over a decade, touring the U.S and abroad.
