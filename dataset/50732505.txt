== Birth and family ==
James William was born in Cowbridge, Glamorgan, Wales. He was the only child of Ernest William Jones of Glamorgan (1870–1941), a trans-European maritime transport magnate, who was the co-owner of the steamship agents M. Jones and Brothers,
and who was also a first-class cricketer, and his wife, Aimée Elizabeth Parson (1873–1913), who was the French-born daughter of James Holmes Parson, a British merchant banker in Italy. His parents were married at the British Consulate in Rouen, Haute Normandie, on 10 September 1900. James William's uncles included Arthur Webb-Jones, the eminent British gynaecologist, and Edwin Jones, Vice-Consul for Chile and Secretary to the Chamber of Commerce. James William's second cousin, William Wynne Jones, was Anglican Bishop of Central Tanganyika. Through his mother, Aimée Parson, James William was a descendant of the London property developer James Burton, who was the father of the architect Decimus Burton.
James William was educated at Cranleigh School, for which he played cricket, and at Worcester College, Oxford, where he was Captain of Cricket. He later attended the University of Grenoble in France, where he received the Diplôme de Hautes Études.

James William was a member of the original side of the Jesters Cricket Club, which was founded in 1928 by John 'Jock' Forbes Burnet (1910 - 1980) of St. Paul's School, London.
