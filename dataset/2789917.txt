She was the lead singer of the pop vocal trio known as the Teddy Bears, which also included Phil Spector.

After their initial hit, the trio disbanded because of the failure of their follow-up singles, and the fact that Spector preferred working behind the scenes to performing.
Some years later she legally changed her name to Carol Connors. She co-wrote (with Ayn Robbins and Bill Conti) "Gonna Fly Now", the theme song from the film Rocky, which earned her an Academy Award nomination. Carol Connors sang the theme to the film Orca, called "We Are One".
