Whilst at the University of Warwick (1965–68), Evans played in the university band which was called The New Economic Model. The band, which mainly played American soul music of the 1960s, played at all the university dances and supported bands such as Pink Floyd and The Move. There is a picture of Evans with the rest of the New Economic Model in "Van der Graaf Generator – The Book".Evans has been a member of Van der Graaf Generator from 1968 until 1978, and since their reformation in 2005.
In addition to his work in Van der Graaf Generator, Evans has collaborated with other musicians, frequently with other (ex-) members of Van der Graaf Generator, as on The Long Hello project and in the K Group. He also works with a group called Echo City constructing "sonic playgrounds", outdoor constructions which can be used to make music, many for disabled children. Evans also worked for a number of years at Shape Arts in an administrative role and as a workshop leader.He has been the drummer in Subterraneans since 2002.
