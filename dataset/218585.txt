By age 5, Powell had appeared on the Portland children's radio program Stars of Tomorrow. She took dance lessons at the Agnes Peters School of Dance, where the Burce family met a talent scout and dance instructor who convinced the family to move to Oakland, California, to attract Hollywood talent agents. After 3 months of living in a hotel room, the family returned to Portland, and her father took a  job managing a Banbury Cross apartment building. While living in Banbury Cross, Powell took singing lessons.As a child, Powell was sexually abused by tenants in the apartment building, but did not disclose the assault to her parents for fear of aggravating her mother, who was an alcoholic and had a volatile temper.When Powell was 12 years old, a talent promoter helped her get selected as the Oregon Victory Girl.

While vacationing in California in 1943, Powell won a Hollywood talent show and signed a contract with MGM Theaters in Hollywood the next day at the age of 14.She wanted to go back to high school and to university, but her mother forbade this as she was the only one making good money.

She secured her place in history with her performance in  Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.Despite bouts with severe depression and insecurity, Powell retained a public image of the all-American girl-next-door and was a symbol of simpler times.
