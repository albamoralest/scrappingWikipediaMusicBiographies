== Entertainment career ==
Liza Wang was born on 28 August 1947 in Shanghai, She moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai in autumn 1956 and signed up for Rediffusion Hong Kong's first Artist Academy class in 1967. From thousands of applicants, the 20-year-old Liza was one of the nine that were picked to attend acting classes. She was also the first to graduate from the academy.


=== Television ===
Her career has spanned four decades, since 1967. She began working for Rediffusion Television Limited (later renamed Asia Television and now defunct) until she joined TVB in 1971. She was one of the members of the all-girl music group Four Golden Flowers. Wang initially made her mark in the entertainment industry in drama series. Her work in front of the camera was followed by that behind the scenes on television productions.
In 2005, she received the Best Actress award during TVB's 38th Anniversary. She received this award the second time for her role in Wars of In-laws. Wang received her first Best Actress award for her drama series The Awakening Story in 2001. She celebrated her 40th anniversary in the entertainment industry in 2007.

She performed duets with singer Adam Cheng. She continues to perform TV theme songs such as "東方之珠" for musical series like the 2006 Glittering Days.


=== Cantonese opera ===

She experimented with stage musicals before becoming a Cantonese opera actress. It was within the Cantonese opera community that Wang met her longtime partner, Law Kar-ying. In 2005 the Sunbeam Theatre in North Point, Hong Kong's only regular venue for Cantonese Opera performances, was planned to close following a change of ownership. Wang decided to negotiate with the new owner, who then promised to extend the contract with the Cantonese Opera groups. Wang then criticized the Government for its lack of support for Cantonese Opera, and the Government promised to adopt Wang's request.
Wang was Chairman of the Chinese Artist Association of Hong Kong (香港八和會館) from 1992 to 1997, then again from 2005 to 2009. In 2007 Wang was awarded the Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award. She was later awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the City University of Hong Kong.
In February 2009 Wang fought for the development rights to restore the North Kowloon Magistracy building (北九龍裁判法院) in Sham Shui Po. The building was originally proposed to be a new Cantonese opera training and performance center. Hong Kong's government granted the bid to the US Savannah College of Art and Design. Wang was upset over the loss, and said the government was only paying lip service to causes such as Cantonese opera.  The magistracy building is to be turned into a school specializing in creative and digital media.


== Political career ==


=== Pan-democrat home return permits request ===
Since the 1997 transfer of sovereignty, the Communist Party of China have banned 8 of the 25 Hong Kong pan-democrat legislative councilors. They are barred from the mainland except for tours organized by the government. On 6 March 2008 Wang began publicizing the need to grant 24 Home Return Permit to the pro-democracy lawmakers.


=== Government Committee ===
On Apr 29, 2020, The Hong Kong SAR announced the appointments to the Cantonese Opera Advisory Committee which aims to promote the development of Cantonese opera, facilitating the transmission of this world intangible cultural heritage item, for the period from May 1, 2020, to April 30, 2022.  Wang is one of the members.


== 2008 Beijing Olympics ==
Wang mentioned that it was good timing to invite the democrats to enter mainland China in time for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
"CPPCC chairman Jia Qinglin said we should unite people from different sectors – why not include the democrats as well?
The Pro-Beijing party Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong member Tam Yiu Chung responded that the Olympics was not a good reason for changing what the central government used to do. Her concerns baffled her colleagues in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Democrat member Albert Ho said the issue of a home visit permit was such a rightful thing. It has never been mentioned by any politician but a performer. He appreciates Wang's efforts. Wang is a member, but not a standing committee member of the CPPCC.


== Community work ==
As a mainstay at the TVB television network, Wang has gained almost legendary status for her efforts not merely as an entertainer but also as a philanthropist with a heart for social works and for improving lives in rural China and other areas. Within Hong Kong, she has also been an MC hosting TVB telethons for Tung Wah Group of Hospitals and many other charities.
Wang, being a two-time cancer survivor (first thyroid then breast cancer), decided to be an executive committee member of the Hong Kong Anti-Cancer Society. A series of informative radio talk shows on RTHK was also hosted where medical specialists were invited to discuss the many types of cancer. She has helped raise charities, awareness and funding for cancer patients. Recently a free concert was given at Tin Shui Wai for 4,500 residents; the concert was filled to capacity and hundreds were turned away. The crowd prevented guest performers like Miriam Yeung and Denise Ho from arriving on time. Denise Ho ascribed the audience overflow to Wang's popularity.


== Personal life ==
Liza Wang was married to businessman Lau Cheong Wah from 1971 to 1983 and they remain good friends.
