=== 1960s ===
The decade found Kellerman making a number of television-series appearances. She was in an episode of the western Cheyenne as well as a role as a waitress in the John Forsythe sitcom Bachelor Father. Struggling for parts in television and films, Kellerman acted on stage. She debuted in Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People,: 55  followed by parts in a Pasadena Playhouse production of Leslie Stevens's The Marriage-Go-Round and Michael Shurtleff's Call Me by My Rightful Name (1962).: 63

A role as Holly Mitchell, perverted mistress of George Peppard's character in the film The Third Day (1965), followed. She played leading lady to David Niven in his television series The Rogues in 1965 for an episode titled "God Bless You, G. Carter Huntington" which revolved around her striking beauty to a large degree, and appeared in a 1965 Alfred Hitchcock Hour episode titled "Thou Still Unravished Bride."
A year later, she played psychiatrist Elizabeth Dehner (who studied the long-term effects of space on a crew) in "Where No Man Has Gone Before", the second pilot for Star Trek. Three months after that, Kellerman played Mag Wildwood in the original Broadway production of Breakfast at Tiffany's, directed by Joseph Anthony and produced by David Merrick, which closed after four preview performances.

In a 1971 Life magazine interview, Kellerman remembered her television years: "It took me eight years to get into TV—and six years to get out. Frigid women, alcoholics they gave me. I got beat up, raped, and never played comedy."


=== 1970s ===
Kellerman received her breakthrough role (Major Margaret "Hot Lips" O'Houlihan in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H) in 1970. Her performance earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations, winning the Kansas City Film Critics Circle (KCFCC) Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Golden Laurel for Best Comedy Performance (Female) and a second-place National Society of Film Critics (NSFC) Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In Manhattan after the film, Kellerman declined an offer for a ten-page spread in Vogue by former editor-in-chief Grace Mirabella.: 118  When she turned down the part of Linda Rogo in The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Stella Stevens got the role.: 146  Shortly afterwards she recorded her first demo with Lou Adler, and Roll with the Feelin for Decca Records with producer-arranger Gene Paige.: 144  After filming Last of the Red Hot Lovers, Kellerman passed up a role in another Altman film:

I had just finished filming Last of the Red Hot Lovers when Bob called me one day at home. "Sally, do you want to be in my picture after next?" he asked. "Only if it's a good part," I said. He hung up on me. Bob was as stubborn and arrogant as I was at the time, but the sad thing is that I cheated myself out of working with someone I loved so much, someone who made acting both fun and easy and who trusted his actors. Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.
Oh, the Altman film I turned down? Nashville. In that part I would have been able to sing. Bad choice.: 146 
Her next roles included a woman involved in a deadly plot in the slasher film A Reflection of Fear; an eccentric woman in the road movie Slither opposite James Caan, and a tormented journalist in Charles Jarrott's musical remake of Frank Capra's Lost Horizon (also contributing to the latter's soundtrack).
