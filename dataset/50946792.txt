Jean-Paul-André des Razins, marquis de Saint-Marc, (29 November 1728 – 11 September 1818) was an 18th-century French playwright and librettist.
A former officer of the Gardes françaises, Saint-Marc wrote the libretto for Adèle de Ponthieu, a five-act tragedy set to music by Niccolò Piccinni. He composed several opéra comique librettos and numerous pieces of fugitive poetry.
In 1778, attending in Paris the famous presentation of Irène, after which the bust of Voltaire was crowned, the marquis de Saint-Marc improvised this quatrain which made him famous:

Saint-Marc was a member of the Académie de Bordeaux. The mansion in the city where he lived and died was registered as Monument historique 23 July 1921.
