Master Madan (Gurmukhi: ਮਾਸਟਰ ਮਦਨ; 28 December 1927 – 5 June 1942) was a talented Ghazal and geet singer of India of pre-independence era.  During his life, he only recorded eight songs, and these are now commonly available.  He was born 28 December 1927, in Khan Khana, a village in District Jalandhar District (now Nawanshahar) of the Punjab. This village was found by reputed courtier of Akbar, Abdul Rahim Khan-i-khana, who was a prolific writer. He died on 5 June 1942, reportedly due to mercury poisoning of his milk while at Shimla.
His eight songs are:

Bagaan wich peengan paiyaan (Punjabi)
Raavi de parle kandey (Punjabi)
Yun naa reh reh kar hamein tarsaaiye (Urdu Ghazal)
Heyrat se tak rahaay hain jahane wafaa mujhe (Urdu Ghazal)
Goree goree baiyaan  (Thumri)
Mori bintee mano kanha re (Thumri)
Man ki man hi mahi rahi (Gurbani)
Chetnaa hei to chet le (Gurbani)
