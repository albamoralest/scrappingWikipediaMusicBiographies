Prior to this, he served as the 5th Vice President of Liberia under President Stephen Allen Benson from 1860 to 1864, and as the 3rd Secretary of State in the cabinet of Joseph Jenkins Roberts from 1854 to 1856.


== Background ==
Warner, an African American, was born on Hookstown Road in Baltimore County, Maryland, to a father who was a farmer and ex-slave who acquired his freedom one year before Warner was born.Warner's date of birth is unclear. Some records show that he was born on April 19, 1815. American Colonization Society documents list him as age nine when he emigrated to Liberia, with eight relatives, on the ship Oswego in 1823.A member of the Americo-Liberian elite, before his presidency, he served as a member of the Liberian House of Representatives, including a term as Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1848 to 1849, and in the Liberian Senate. Following his presidency, in 1877, he became an agent of the American Colonization Society.He also wrote the lyrics to the Liberian national anthem, which the country officially adopted when it became independent from the American Colonization Society in 1847.


== Presidency (1864–1868) ==
Warner's main concern as president was his government's relationship with the area's indigenous people, particularly those in the interior of the country. He organized the first expedition into the dense forest, led by Benjamin J. K. Anderson. In 1868, Anderson traveled into Liberia's interior to sign a treaty with the king of Musardu. He took careful notes describing the peoples, the customs, and the natural resources of those areas he passed through, writing a published report of his journey. Using the information from Anderson's report, the Liberian government moved to assert limited control over the inland region.
