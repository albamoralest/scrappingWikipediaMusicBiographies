He was a program host and producer for the Canadian entertainment channel Star!. He also hosts two weekly radio programs on Alberta public radio station CKUA: Mulligan Stew, a long-running two-hour music program, and Tasting Room Radio, a one-hour weekly food and wine radio program about food, wine and winemakers, and with a rock and roll attitude. Tasting Room Radio is also broadcast on CKFR AM 1150 in Kelowna, British Columbia, and CKST AM 1040 in Vancouver.
