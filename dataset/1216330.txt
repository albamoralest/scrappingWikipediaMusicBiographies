She choreographed both the stage version and screen versions of The Music Man (1962), 1776 (1972) and Mame (1974). Douglas subsequently married Susan Luckey, who played the role of Zaneeta in the film of The Music Man.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voted White an Academy Honorary Award for Oliver! (1968), one of the rare occasions that the Academy recognized choreography in film. Other recipients include Gene Kelly for "career achievements", Jerome Robbins for "choreographic achievement on film", Michael Kidd (White's mentor) for "services to the art of dance in the art of the screen" and Stanley Donen for "body of work".  Fred Astaire's was much earlier, and was for his body of work.
