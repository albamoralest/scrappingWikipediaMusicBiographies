One of his paintings was used on the cover for the 2008 Joyce Carol Oates novel My Sister, My Love.

They have a daughter, Maggie.In a 2010 interview on The Green Room with Paul Provenza, Mull identified himself as an agnostic, saying "I certainly don't begrudge someone else their choice to follow whatever they do, it's just for me, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I think more harm has come to this planet through organized religion, probably, than any single situation that we've invented."
