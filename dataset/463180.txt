George Henry Sanders (3 July 1906 – 25 April 1972) was a British actor whose spanned over 40 years. His heavy, upper-class English accent and smooth, bass voice often led him to be cast as sophisticated but villainous characters. He is perhaps best known as Jack Favell in Rebecca (1940), Scott ffolliott in Foreign Correspondent (1940, a rare heroic part), The Saran of Gaza in Samson and Delilah (1949), the most popular film of the year, Addison DeWitt in All About Eve (1950, for which he won an Oscar), Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert in Ivanhoe (1952), King Richard the Lionheart in King Richard and the Crusaders (1954), Mr. Freeze in a two-parter episode of Batman (1966), the voice of Shere Khan in Disney's The Jungle Book (1967), the suave crimefighter The Falcon during the 1940s (a role eventually bequeathed to his elder brother, Tom Conway), and Simon Templar, The Saint, in five films made in the 1930s and 1940s.


== Early life ==
Sanders was born on 3 July 1906 in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, at number 6 Petrovski Ostrov. His parents were Henry Peter Ernest Sanders (1868–1960), and Margarethe Jenny Bertha Sanders (née Kolbe; 1883–1967), who was born in Saint Petersburg, of mostly German, but also Estonian and Scottish, ancestry. A biography published in 1990 claimed that Sanders' father was the illegitimate son of a prince of the House of Oldenburg and a Russian noblewoman of the Tsar’s court, married to a sister of the Tsar. Actor Tom Conway (1904–1967) was George Sanders' elder brother. Their younger sister, Margaret Sanders, was born in 1912.
In 1917, at the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, Sanders and his family moved to Great Britain. Like his brother, he attended Bedales School and Brighton College, a boys' independent school in Brighton, then went on to Manchester Technical College, after which he worked in textile research.Sanders travelled to South America, where he managed a tobacco plantation. The Depression sent him back to Britain.  He worked at an advertising agency, where the company secretary,  aspiring actress Greer Garson, suggested that he take up a career in acting.


== Career ==


=== Early British work ===
Sanders learned how to sing and got a role on stage in Ballyhoo, which only had a short run, but helped establish him as an actor.He began to work regularly on the British stage, appearing several times with Edna Best. He co-starred with Dennis King in The Command Performance.  He appeared in a British film, Love, Life and Laughter (1934).
Sanders travelled to New York to appear on Broadway in a production of Noël Coward's Conversation Piece (1934), directed by Coward, which only ran for 55 performances.He returned to Britain, where he had small parts in films such as  Things to Come (1936), Strange Cargo (1936), Find the Lady (1936), The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936), and Dishonour Bright (1936).


=== Hollywood and 20th Century Fox ===
Some of these British films were distributed by 20th Century Fox, which was looking for an actor to play a villain in its Hollywood-shot film Lloyd's of London (1936). Sanders was duly cast as Lord Everett Stacy, opposite Tyrone Power, in one of his first leads, as the hero; Sanders' smooth, upper-class English accent, his sleek manner, and his suave, superior, and somewhat threatening air made him in demand for American films for years to come.Lloyds of London was a big hit, and in November 1936, Fox placed Sanders under a seven-year contract.Fox cast him opposite Power again in Love Is News (1937), then he supported Wallace Beery in Slave Ship (1937) and Gloria Stuart in The Lady Escapes (1937).
Public response to Sanders had been strong, so Fox gave him his first heroic lead, in the B picture Lancer Spy (1937) with Dolores del Río. Del Río and he were promptly reteamed in International Settlement (1938).
Sanders was second-billed (to Richard Greene) in John Ford's Four Men and a Prayer (1938), and Fox had him play a villain in Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939).
Sanders returned to Britain to make The Outsider (1939) for Associated British Picture Corporation and So This Is London (1939) for Fox.


=== The Saint, The Falcon, and character roles ===
Sanders returned to Hollywood, where RKO wanted him to play the hero in a series of B-movies, The Saint. The Saint in New York (1938) had already been made starring Louis Hayward in the title role, but when he decided not to return to the role, Sanders took over for The Saint Strikes Back (1939). Sanders was now being cast as international villains: in Mr. Moto's Last Warning, Confessions of a Nazi Spy, Nurse Edith Cavell, and Allegheny Uprising (all 1939).
RKO sent Sanders to Britain, where its British unit (including director John Paddy Carstairs) filmed The Saint in London (1939). He played a double role in The Saint's Double Trouble (1940), then went to Universal for Green Hell (1940) and The House of the Seven Gables (1940).
Alfred Hitchcock cast him in a supporting role for Rebecca (1940), a huge success. After The Saint Takes Over (1940), Hitchcock used him again in Foreign Correspondent (1940).
MGM used him as a villain in Bitter Sweet (1940), and he performed a similar function for Edward Small in The Son of Monte Cristo (1940). Sanders made his last appearance as Simon Templar in The Saint in Palm Springs (1941), then MGM called him back for Rage in Heaven (1941), an early film noir, playing the trustworthy good guy whose best friend, Robert Montgomery, goes murderously insane and sets him up for the rap.
Sanders was a Nazi in Man Hunt (1941), but heroic in Sundown (1941).


=== The Falcon ===
RKO had been in dispute with Leslie Charteris, creator of The Saint, so they stopped the series and put Sanders in a new B picture series about a suave crimefighter, The Falcon. The first entry was The Gay Falcon (1941). It was popular and quickly followed by A Date with the Falcon (1942).
At Fox, he was in Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake (1942) with Tyrone Power, then it was back to The Falcon Takes Over (1942), based on Farewell, My Lovely.
MGM used him in Her Cardboard Lover (1942), and he was one of several stars in Tales of Manhattan (1942).
Sanders tired of playing The Falcon, so he handed the role to his brother Tom Conway in The Falcon's Brother (1942), in which both appeared (and Sanders' character was killed off). The only other film in which the two siblings appeared together was Death of a Scoundrel (1956), in which they also played brothers.


=== A-picture leading man ===
Sanders was borrowed by United Artists to play the lead in an A film, The Moon and Sixpence (1942), based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham.In July 1942, Fox suspended him for refusing the lead in The Undying Monster (1942). "I like to be seen in pictures that at least seem to be slightly worthwhile." In September, they suspended him again for refusing an "unsympathetic role" in The Immortal Sergeant (he was replaced by Morton Lowry). In November, Fox and Sanders came to terms, with the studio offering him a raise in pay and the lead in a film, School for Saboteurs, which became They Came to Blow Up America.Sanders was a pirate villain in The Black Swan (1943), again fighting Tyrone Power, at Fox; the same studio used him in Quiet Please, Murder (1943).
RKO called him back for This Land Is Mine (1943). They bought an original story for him, Nine Lives, but it does not appear to have been made.He was lent to Columbia for Appointment in Berlin (1943).In February 1943, Fox announced it was developing three film projects for Sanders – The Porcelain Lady, a murder mystery, plus biopics of the Earl of Suffolk and Bethune.Fox originally announced him to play the role of the detective in Laura (1944) alongside Laird Cregar, but neither ended up being in the final film.Fox finished his long-term contract with the studio in Paris After Dark (1943) and The Lodger (1944), playing the romantic lead to Laird Cregar's title villain.


=== RKO ===
Sanders signed a new three-film contract with RKO, starting with Action in Arabia (1944). After starring as a tragic Russian judge in Summer Storm (1944), Fox called him back to do a Lodger follow-up with Cregar, Hangover Square (1945).
Sanders played Lord Henry Wotton in the film version of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) at MGM, and had the lead in The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry (1946) at Universal. He did three films for United Artists: A Scandal in Paris (1946), The Strange Woman (1946), and The Private Affairs of Bel Ami (1947).
Sanders was the third lead in the elegiac The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) at Fox, supporting Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison.
After playing the lead in Lured (1947), Fox cast him as Charles II in its expensive Forever Amber (1949). The same studio used him in The Fan (1949). He was a villain in Cecil B. DeMille's biblical epic Samson and Delilah (1949), the most popular film of the year.


=== All About Eve and beyond ===

For his role as the acerbic, cold-blooded theatre critic Addison DeWitt in All About Eve (1950), Sanders won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.He was a leading man in Black Jack (1950), but was back to supporting/villain roles in I Can Get It for You Wholesale (1951). He signed a three-picture deal with MGM,  for which he did The Light Touch (1951) and Ivanhoe (1952), playing Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert and dying in a duel with Robert Taylor after professing his love for Jewish maiden Rebecca, played by Elizabeth Taylor. It was a huge success.He followed it with Assignment – Paris! (1952), a thriller; Call Me Madam (1953), a rare musical role for Sanders; and Witness to Murder (1954). He starred as King Richard the Lionheart in King Richard and the Crusaders (1954).
Sanders went to Italy to appear opposite Ingrid Bergman in Journey to Italy (1954). Back in Hollywood, he made several movies for MGM: Jupiter's Darling (1955), Moonfleet (1955), The Scarlet Coat (1955), and The King's Thief (1955) (again as Charles II).In 1955, he was announced as hosting and occasionally appearing in The Ringmaster, a TV series about the circus. The series was never made. Instead, Sanders was in "A Portrait of a Murderer" on The 20th Century-Fox Hour, a remake of Laura (1944), playing the role of Waldo Lydecker, made famous by Clifton Webb.
Sanders was then usually a supporting actor: Never Say Goodbye (1956), While the City Sleeps (1956), That Certain Feeling (1956). On television Sanders appeared with his wife Zsa Zsa Gabor in The Ford Television Theatre ("Autumn Fever"), and he had roles in Screen Directors Playhouse.

=== Novels ===
Two ghostwritten crime novels were published under his name to cash in on his fame at the height of his wartime film series.  The first was Crime on My Hands (1944), written in the first person, and mentioning his Saint and Falcon films. This was followed by Stranger at Home in 1946. Both were written by female authors: the former was by Craig Rice, and the latter by Leigh Brackett.


=== Singing ===

In 1958, Sanders recorded an album called The George Sanders Touch: Songs for the Lovely Lady. The album, released by ABC-Paramount Records, featured lush string arrangements of romantic ballads, crooned by Sanders in a fit baritone/bass (spanning from low to middle C), including "Such is My Love", a song he had himself composed. After going to great lengths to get the role, he appeared in the Broadway cast of South Pacific, but was overwhelmed with anxiety over the singing and quickly dropped out. His singing voice can be heard in The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry, Summer Storm, and  Call Me Madam. He also signed on for the role of Sheridan Whiteside in the stage musical Sherry! (1967), based on Kaufman and Hart's play The Man Who Came to Dinner, but he found the stage production demanding and quit after his wife Benita Hume discovered that she had terminal bone cancer.
During the production of The Jungle Book, Sanders was unavailable to provide the singing voice for his character Shere Khan during the final recording of the song, "That's What Friends Are For". According to Richard Sherman, Bill Lee, a member of The Mellomen, was called in to substitute for Sanders.


== Personal life ==
On 27 October 1940, Sanders married Susan Larson (real name Elsie Poole). The couple divorced in 1949. From later that year until 1954, Sanders was married to Zsa Zsa Gabor, with whom he starred in the film Death of a Scoundrel (1956). On 10 February 1959, Sanders married Benita Hume, widow of Ronald Colman. She died of bone cancer in 1967, aged 60, the same year that Sanders's brother Tom Conway died of liver failure. Sanders had become distant from his brother because of Tom's drinking problem. Sanders endured a further blow in the same year with the death of their mother Margarethe, meaning that Sanders suffered three bereavements in a very short period of time.
Sanders' autobiography Memoirs of a Professional Cad was published in 1960 and gathered critical praise for its wit. Sanders suggested the title A Dreadful Man for his biography, later written by his friend Brian Aherne and published in 1979. Sanders's fourth and last marriage on 4 December 1970 was to Magda Gabor, the elder sister of his second wife. This marriage lasted only 32 days, after which he began drinking heavily.


== Final years and death ==

Sanders suffered from dementia in the last few years of his life, worsened by waning health, and visibly teetered in his last films, owing to a loss of balance.
Even before his dementia, Sanders had grown increasingly reclusive and depressed due to a string of tragedies including the deaths of his third wife, his mother, and his brother Tom in the space of a year, followed by a failed sausage investment, which cost him millions, dementia diagnosis, a quick divorce from his fourth wife, and a volatile on-off relationship over four years with another woman. According to Aherne's biography, he also had a minor stroke. Sanders could not bear the prospect of losing his health or needing help to carry out everyday tasks, and became deeply depressed. About this time, he found that he could no longer play his grand piano, so he dragged it outside and smashed it with an axe. His last girlfriend, Lorraine Chanel, with whom he had an on-off relationship in the last four years of his life, persuaded him to sell his beloved house in Majorca, Spain, which he later bitterly regretted. From then on, he drifted.On 23 April 1972, Sanders checked into a hotel in Castelldefels, a coastal town near Barcelona, where he phoned his friend George Mikell. He died of a cardiac arrest two days later after swallowing the contents of five bottles of the barbiturate Nembutal. He left behind two suicide notes, one of which read:

Dear World, I am leaving because I am bored. I feel I have lived long enough. I am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool. Good luck.
Sanders's body was returned to Britain for funeral services. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the English Channel.
David Niven wrote in Bring on the Empty Horses (1975), the second volume of his memoirs, that in 1937, his friend George Sanders had predicted that he would commit suicide from a barbiturate overdose when he was 65, and that in his 50s, he had appeared to be depressed because his marriages had failed and several tragedies had befallen him.


== Honours and references in popular culture ==
Sanders has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for films at 1636 Vine Street and television at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard.Ray Davies pays homage to grace and elegance projected by Sanders in his classic Kinks song "Celluloid Heroes" with the lyric "If you covered him with garbage / George Sanders would still have style."George Sanders is mentioned in "House Arrest," the 24th episode of The Sopranos.
