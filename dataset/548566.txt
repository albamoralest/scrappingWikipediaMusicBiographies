Ti Yete Aneeka Jate..Yetana kadhi kalya aneete ती येते आणिक जाते,येतांना कधि कळ्या आणिते,

He Chincheche zad dise maj chinar vrukshapari हे चिंचेचे झाड दिसे मज चिनार वृक्षापरी
Ratris khel chale ya gudh chandanyacha, sampel na kadhihi ha khel savalyancha रात्रीस खेळ चाले या गूढ चांदण्याचासंपेल ना कधीही हा खेळ सावल्यांचा

Abol Zalis ka saajani.. अबोल झालीस का साजणी
Saang kadhi kalanar tula.. सांग कधी कळणार तुला
Sur tech chhedita.. सूर तेच छेडीता, गीत उमटले नवे
Madhu ithe ana chandra tithe..  मधू इथे अन् चंद्र तिथे झुरतो अंधारात
Swapnaat pahile je te roop hech hote.. स्वप्‍नात पाहिले जे ते रूप हेच होते
Nako menaka nako urvashi ...      * Var dhagala lagli khala pani themb themb gala वरं ढगाला लागली कळं....पाणी थेंब थेंब गळं....
