He subsequently secured private funding for the orchestra, and served as its first music director.  After the orchestra's public debut in 1994, he recorded and performed with it in concerts worldwide.  He conducted the Prague Philharmonia at its first BBC Proms appearance in 2004, in a televised performance.  In 2005, he relinquished his post with the Prague Philharmonia, and subsequently became the orchestra's conductor laureate.  He conducted his final concert on 7 May 2017 with the Prague Philharmonia.

In January 2017, the Czech Philharmonic announced the extension of Bělohlávek's contract through the 2021–2022 season.  He remained in the post until his death on 31 May 2017.
