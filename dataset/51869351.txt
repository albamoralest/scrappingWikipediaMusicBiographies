== Memoirs ==
Pulak Bandyopadhyay, the famous and noted lyricist of Bengal of the yesteryear, mentioned in his memoir: "When the song "Ke prothom kachhe esechhi", written by me and sung by Manna De and Lata Mangeskar, became popular, I received a call from a mysterious fan, praising the lyrics. She did not reveal her name. Since then I used to receive call from her whenever a song written by me became a sensation. At last one day she agreed to come to meet me at certain location in Elgin road at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. I was overwhelmed. The time was approaching, and cleaned my car and got dressed. Then the phone rang. It was Hemanta Mukherjee. He insisted that I should visit his house for creation of Puja songs at 5 o'clock. Pratima Bandopadhyay would be there waiting. All my persuasion to change the date failed. While driving my car towards Hemanta-da's house, the clock was approaching 5, I was thinking about the mysterious lady, and first two lines came in to my mind, "Baro saadh jaage, ekbar tomay dekhi" (I wanna see you just for once). Never heard of the lady ever after. Pratima recorded the song."
Nirmla Mishra recalled: "One night at about 12 o'clock I received a phone call. It was a great surprise for me, because the caller was none other than the famous artist Pratima Bandopadhyay. She told, 'Nirmala, Manab Babu had given us a song. Let us practice it here.' Regularly Pratima Bandopadhyay used to call me after mid night for practice." The song was: Abire Rangalo Ke Amay /Film Mukhujjye Paribar (1956).
