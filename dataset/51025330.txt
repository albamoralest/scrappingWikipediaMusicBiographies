Pierre Wissmer (30 October 1915 – 4 November 1992) was a 20th-century French classical composer of Swiss origin.


== Biography ==
Formed at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève, he received the advice of Robert Casadesus before perfecting his mastery of counterpoint at the Schola Cantorum de Paris with Daniel-Lesur. He also followed the course of conducting of Charles Münch at the École normale de musique de Paris.
His first piano concerto was created on the radio by Jacqueline Blancard 10 October 1937 under the direction of Henri Tomasi. In 1938, his first symphony was directed in Winterthur by Hermann Scherchen.
In 1939, Pierre Wissmer composed Le beau dimanche, one-act ballet on an argument by Pierre Guérin who put him in touch with Stravinski, Poulenc, Sauguet, and Cocteau. In 1944, he was appointed professor of composition at Conservatoire de Genève and head of the Department of chamber music at Radio Geneva.
In 1948, he married the pianist Laure-Anne Étienne, a student of Marguerite Long at Conservatoire de Paris. From 1952 to 1957, he was deputy director of programs at Radio Luxembourg and, from 1957, director of the Schola Cantorum. In 1958 he adopted French citizenship and later was appointed director of the École normale de musique of Le Mans (1969–1981).
In 1967, he was awarded the Grand Prix musical of the city of Paris.
In 1992, he died in Valcros, shortly after his wife.
