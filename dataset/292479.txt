Viktor Savvich Klimenko (born 24 November 1942) is a singer who made himself known as the "Singing Cossack".


== Biography ==

Klimenko was born in Karelia, to a Ukrainian Cossack father, Savva Klimenko, and a Russian mother, Olga Glotova. A few years after his birth, his family moved to Finland. There, he became a musician and appeared in several films, mostly appearing as himself. The Eurovision Song Contest 1965 was his first appearance outside of Finland; his song didn't earn any points in the competition.In 1970, Klimenko released the album Stenka Rasin across Europe.  The album, containing Russian songs, went gold in the Finnish marketâ€”the first record to do so in Finland. Later, it was certified platinum. This success was followed by a decade of concerts around the world. Klimeno had nine more gold records and one more platinum record.
In 1973, he played in the Norwegian "comedy-humour-musical" Kofferten (Swedish: Ryck mig i vaskan), a co-operation between Sveriges Radio, BBC, YLE, and NRK.
Klimenko rebranded himself as a Gospel singer in 1980, after having a personal religious revelation.
