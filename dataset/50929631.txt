== Biography ==
On 18 May 1917, released from military service, Roger Toziny joined in Paris with another chansonnier, Maurice Hallé and a cartoonist, Jules Depaquit, to create a satirical four pages weekly entitled La Vache enragée, taking the name of a former carnival parade. With his two friends, he also participated in the creation of the free commune of Montmartre in April 1920.In February 1921, Roger Toziny and Maurice Hallet founded a new cabaret in Montmartre, at 4 place Constantin-Pecqueur, and gave it the name of their review, La Vache enragée. There he met Pierre Dac, alias André Isaac, who he managed to convince, despite his shyness, to perform on stage, and for who he found his pseudonym "Dac". Other artists made their debut in the venue such as Raymond Souplex or Léo Malet. On 17 avril 1921, Roger Toziny also organized the first "scabs fair" in order to help the needy painters.When Jules Depaquit died in 1924, he succeeded him as mayor of the "free commune of Montmartre". He later became the boss of another cabaret, Le Caveau des oubliettes rouges, still in Montmartre.
During the 1930s, he played as an actor in films, in particular in a feature film by Marie Epstein and Jean Benoît-Lévy 
Hélène. He is also the author of a collection of old songs of France, entitled Absence or Les chansons de mon âme.
