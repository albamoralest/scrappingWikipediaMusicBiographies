Kamae was introduced to Gabby Pahinui in 1959, and the slack key virtuoso demonstrated a new way to make the 'ukulele "talk story".  Kamae himself would come to be known for his inventive methods of plucking all four strings simultaneously, playing the chords and melody at the same time. They began playing together and formed Sons of Hawaii, with their first paying gig at The Sand Box.
