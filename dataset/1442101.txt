Hutton was born in Bloomington, Illinois. Her parents were Marvel Svea Williams and Odie Daniel Cowan. June and her older sister, Ina Ray Hutton, both grew up to be entertainers and performers during the Big Band era.
Growing up in Chicago, Hutton attended Hyde Park High School, as did her older sister, Ina. While attending high school, she worked in the dress department at Marshall Fields department store. When she was 15, she left home to join her sister in pursuit of a singing career.

In her early days, she sang at the Astor Roof in New York City. After singing with her sister's orchestra in 1938, she was part of the Winston Trio, the Quintones, and the Sande Williams Band. She appeared with the Quintones in Hi Ya, Gentlemen, a failed musical with boxer Max Baer. In 1941, she became the female vocalist for the Stardusters, the singing group of Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra.After Jo Stafford left The Pied Pipers in 1944, Hutton replaced her, joining the group in May. She performed with the Pied Pipers for six years, recording several hit records including the song "Dream." In 1950, Hutton left the Pied Pipers, going solo on Decca Records. (However, the trade publication Billboard reported in its December 10, 1949, issue that Hutton had already left the Pied Pipers and signed with Decca Records.)

In 1952, she went to Capitol Records, backed by an orchestra led by her husband. She recorded three hit records at Capitol: "Say You're Mine Again", "No Stone Unturned", and "For the First Time". They also recorded a well-regarded 1955 album, Afterglow, featuring lush arrangements and the vocal group Boys Next Door.
