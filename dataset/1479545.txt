== Biography ==
Quim Barreiros was born in June 19, 1947 in Vila Praia de Âncora, municipality of Caminha, Viana do Castelo District, to a Portuguese mother and a Brazilian father.When he was 9 years old, he started playing the drums in his father's band (Conjunto Alegria), after some years he started playing the accordion along with his father, until he joined a folklore group called Sta. Marta de Portuzelo and started touring around Portugal and some nearby countries like Spain and France, which allowed Quim to meet lots of folklore artists from different regions and with different styles.
When he was 20 years old, he had to undergo mandatory military service in Lisbon, and then joined the Portuguese Air Force, as well as the Air Force's band. His involvement with the Air Force band also meant that Quim wouldn't get sent to the wars on the Portuguese colonies.
In the day Quim dealt with his military duties, at night he started attending Casas de Fado (Houses of Fado), places where you can have a meal while listening to Fado classics, and eventually started having concerts in these houses. Quim's music contrasted with the serenity and sternness of Fado, but was well received.
In 1971, Quim releases his first LP Quim Barreiros – Acordeão , then in 1974 he released his second LP Quim Barreiros – Povo Que Canta. These were composed mostly of Portuguese folklore classics. After these, Quim started writing his own songs and developing his spicy, double meaning lyricism.
Quim then toured several countries that have Portuguese emigrant communities such as the United States, Canada, France, Germany and more.
In the meantime he continued releasing some albums and compilations full of funny scenarios and double meaning, eventually becoming one of the most loved Portuguese musicians at the time.
His music reached both the old and the young demographic, and in the middle of the 80's, he started performing at student association parties such as Queima das Fitas, Academic Week and freshman receptions, a tradition maintained alive to this day.
