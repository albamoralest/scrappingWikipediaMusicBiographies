Charles François Marie Laffillé (30 September 1771 –16 April 1848) was a 19th-century French composer, poet, theatre manager and music publisher.
The son of a bailiff of the Duke of Orléans, Laffillé was tax collector of the "domaines" in Brussels during 12 years (1798–1810) before he returned to Paris where he published collections of romances and established a music publishing company.
In 1831, he was director of the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels during at least one year but was forced to file for bankruptcy. Back in Paris, he continued to publish.
