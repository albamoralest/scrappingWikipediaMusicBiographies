Frans Oskar Merikanto (pronounced [ˈoskɑr ˈmeriˌkɑnto] (listen); né Ala-Kanto; 5 August 1868 – 17 February 1924) was a Finnish musician and composer.


== Biography ==
He was the son of Frans Ferdinand Ala-Kanto (his surname is also reported as Aittomäki; 1845–1891) from Jalasjärvi, Southern Ostrobothnia and Anna Helena Merikanto (née Tammelin; 1842–1885). Frans got a Swedish-language surname, Mattsson, when he joined the Finnish army. His father had changed the family name from Ala-Kanto to Merikanto in 1882. Meri means "sea" and refers to his voyage from Vaasa to Helsinki; Kanto refers to his origins from the estate Kanto.

He studied for some time at the Leipzig Conservatory in Germany, where his teachers were Carl Reinecke, Theodor Coccius, Robert Papperitz, Willy Rechenberg and Gustav Schreck.He was notable for his variety of talents – he gave concerts all around Finland, performing on the piano and organ, conducting orchestras, and composing original music. Some of his most beloved compositions are Där björkarna susa, the waltz Kesäilta (Summer Evening Waltz) and the Valse lente Op. 33.

Merikanto's style is reminiscent of Finnish folk songs, but has its basis in Italian bel canto.

He died in Hausjärvi-Oitti.
