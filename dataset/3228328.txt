Tatyana Mikhailovna Lioznova (Russian: Татья́на Миха́йловна Лио́знова; 20 July 1924 – 29 September 2011) was a Soviet film director best known for her TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring (1973).


== Film career ==
All of Lioznova's features - from Three Poplars in Plyushcikha (1967), a cult film of the 1960s, to her last movie, Carnival (1981), - are distinguished by open narratives, psychologically penetrating close-ups, and poignant musical scores.
The subtle and touching drama Three Poplars at Plyuschikha Street (1967) sprouted from Aleksandra Pakhmutova’s song “Tenderness”. The starry duet of Tatiana Doronina and Oleg Yefremov is a masterpiece of acting. This story of a nearly sprung love of a taxi driver and a married peasant woman won the hearts of Russian viewers, just like Casablanca gained the love of Americans.
Known as a tireless perfectionist, filming just half a dozen features, this didn't prevent her becoming People's Artist of the USSR in 1984. She worked at the Gorky Film Studio.
Lioznova devoted many efforts and much time to teaching. Among the students of Professor Lioznova there are a lot of cinematographers well-known today.

Lioznova was never married, but adopted a daughter Lyudmila Lisina in the 1960s.
