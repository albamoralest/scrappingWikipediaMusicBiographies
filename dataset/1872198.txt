Bhagavan Das (Devanagari: भगवान दास) (born 'Kermit Michael Riggs' on May 17, 1945), also known as Baba Bhagavan Das, is an American yogi who lived for six years in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Bhagavan Das is a bhakti yogi, a shakta tantra adept, a spiritual teacher, kirtan singer, and author.


== History ==
In 1963 at the age of 18, Bhagavan Das left California and journeyed solo through Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East, eventually arriving in India. In 1965, Bhagavan Das met his guru, the Hindu holy man Neem Karoli Baba. Bhagavan Das became an initiate and devotee of Neem Karoli Baba. He also met Kalu Rinpoche of the Shangpa Kagyudpa lineage. Bhagavan Das received the Vajrayogini empowerment from the Sixteenth Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje of the Karma Kagyu lineage and Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the 11th Trungpa Tulku. During the six years he spent as a wandering ascetic in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka he received numerous initiations and teachings from saints and sages including A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Swami Chaitanya Prakashananda Tirtha, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri Anandamayi Ma, and Tarthang Tulku of the Dudjom Rinpoche lineage.In 1967, Bhagavan Das guided spiritual teacher Ram Dass (known then as Dr. Richard Alpert) throughout India, eventually introducing him to Neem Karoli Baba. Bhagavan Das gained fame after being featured in Ram Dass' 1971 book Be Here Now, which described Bhagavan Das' role in Ram Dass' spiritual journeys in India. Throughout his life, Bhagavan Das has traveled extensively offering traditional and non-traditional Indian bhajans and kirtans, as well as offering yogic and spiritual teachings that stem from the initiations, lineages and teachings passed onto him from the masters. Bhagavan Das is the author of the 1997 autobiography, It's Here Now (Are You?). In 2002, Bhagavan Das released his seventh full album, called Now, that was produced and arranged by Mike D of the Beastie Boys, an East-meets-West musical pairing that broadened the scope of Bhagavan Das' audience.


== Current ==
On October 1, 2020, Bhagavan Das married his beloved wife Amulya Maa. They originally met in 2007, but it was not until late 2018 that they reconnected to deepen into partnership, both personally and professionally. In early 2019, Bhagavan Das and Amulya Maa began singing, teaching and offering sessions and events together, and they continue to do so today.
