William Gaxton (né Arturo Antonio Gaxiola, December 2, 1893 – February 2, 1963) was a star of vaudeville, film, and theatre. Gaxton was president of The Lambs Club from 1936 to 1939, 1952 to 1953, and 1957 to 1961. He and Victor Moore became a popular theatre team in the 1930s and 1940s; they also appeared in several films and shorts together. Although a fine vocalist, Gaxton's strength was his comic timing, and he often requested songs of his be removed from shows in favor of giving him more time for comedic scenes. An example of this was the removal of "Easy to Love" from Cole Porter's  Anything Goes. The song reappeared in the show 53 years later, sung by Howard McGillin in the 1987 Broadway revival.
