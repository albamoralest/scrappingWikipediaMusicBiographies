This course taught the classics in translation instead of the original Latin or Greek, a concept he elaborated in his noted essay  The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent.

These included Penelope's Man and Adam and Eve, Though He Knew Better.Erskine was also an accomplished composer, pianist and musician.
