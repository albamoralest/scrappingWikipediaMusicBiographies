(Crawford won the Best Actress award for that film).
After Mildred Pierce, Blyth sustained a broken back while tobogganing in Snow Valley and was not able to fully capitalize on the film's success.
She recovered and made two films for Mark Hellinger's unit at Universal: Swell Guy (1946), with Sonny Tufts, and Brute Force (1947) with Burt Lancaster. During this time her father died. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer loaned her to play the female lead in Killer McCoy (1947), a boxing film with Mickey Rooney that was a box office hit.Back at Universal she did a film noir with Charles Boyer and Jessica Tandy, A Woman's Vengeance (1948), effecting a British accent. She was then cast in the part of Regina Hubbard in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest (1948), an adaptation of the 1946 play where Regina had been played by Patricia Neal. The play was a prequel to The Little Foxes. Blyth followed it with Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid (1948) with William Powell.  She was top billed in Red Canyon (1949), a Western with Howard Duff.

=== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ===
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had been interested in Blyth since she worked at the studio on The Great Caruso. In December 1953, she left Universal and signed a long-term contract with MGM.She was the leading lady in All the Brothers Were Valiant (1953) with Stewart Granger and Robert Taylor, stepping in for Elizabeth Taylor who had to drop out due to pregnancy.On television, she appeared in The Lux Video Theatre version of A Place in the Sun with John Derek and Marilyn Erskine.
Back at MGM, Blyth had the lead in the remake of Rose Marie (1954) with Howard Keel, which earned over $5 million but lost money due to high costs. Plans to remake other MacDonald-Eddy films (such as The Girl of the Golden West) were discussed but did not work out.
Blyth was meant to be reteamed with Lanza in The Student Prince (1954) but he was fired from the studio and replaced in the picture by Edmund Purdom; the film did well at the box office.
Blyth and Purdom were reunited in a swashbuckler, The King's Thief (1955), with David Niven. She was teamed again with Keel on the musical Kismet (1955); despite strong reviews the film was a financial flop.She was named as the female lead in The Adventures of Quentin Durward (1955) but instead Kay Kendall was cast in the film. For her final picture at the studio, MGM put Blyth in Slander (1957) opposite Van Johnson.


=== Final features ===
