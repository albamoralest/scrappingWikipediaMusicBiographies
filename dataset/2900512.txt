In 1971, Welch recorded an album, Clowns, including songs he had co-written with Tom Paxton, and session musicians including Mike de Albuquerque and Cozy Powell. In 1972, he acted as producer on a version of "I Don't Know How to Love Him" by Sylvie McNeill  on a UK 45 on United Artists UA UP35415 released in time for the first UK Stage Musical of Jesus Christ Superstar. In 1973 he wrote the title song to Spike Milligan's film Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall, which marked the start of a 25-year collaboration with Milligan.
Welch made his television debut in 1972, on The Old Grey Whistle Test. In 1978 and 1979, he appeared in the Spike Milligan BBC series Q8 and Q9, performing his own songs (including "The Carpet is Always Greener Under Someone Else's Bed" and "Love to Make Music by") and songs co-written with Milligan, including "I've Got This Photograph of You!" and "Silly Old Baboon". This unlikely duo released an album in 1979 on the United Artists label, Spike Milligan and Ed Welch Sing Songs from Q8. In 1976, he composed the score for Milligan's adaptation of Paul Gallico's The Snow Goose. Narrated by Milligan and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra with Welch conducting, the RCA recording was such a success that it entered the pop LP charts and has been performed at many concerts since.Welch's songs have been recorded by artists including Cilla Black, Davy Jones, Shirley Bassey, Matt Monro, Design, and Tina Reynolds, whose recording of 'When Morning Has Come' reached number 20 on the Irish charts in 1973. Welch co-wrote the 1995 Icelandic entry to the Eurovision Song Contest, Núna, (with Björgvin Halldórsson).

Also in 1978, he composed the score for the remake of The Thirty Nine Steps, including an extended piano piece entitled The Thirty Nine Steps Concerto (a nod to Richard Addinsell's Warsaw Concerto), later recording it with Christopher Headington as soloist. In the same year, he moved to the West Country where he was appointed Musical Director for Television South West (TSW). He composed the station identification music for TSW, as well as scores for TSW films such as the musical Doubting Thomas (1983; written by John Bartlett, starring Paul Nicholas and Stephanie Lawrence), and numerous local programmes, including Gus Honeybun in 1987.  Welch also composed and conducted music for Television South (TVS), from 1987 until the channel disappeared on 31 December 1992. His credits at TVS included conducting a live two and a half hour New Year's Eve show, with 56 musical items, some of which he had also arranged.In 1982 Welch composed the score for the play Private Dick, by Richard Maher and Roger Michell.
