Robert Earl (born Monty Leigh, 17 November 1926) was an English singer of traditional pop music in the United Kingdom in the 1950s and 1960s, whose style was operatic, like fellow crooners David Whitfield, David Hughes and Edmund Hockridge. He is the father of the businessman Robert Earl.


== Career ==
He began his singing career at local functions around London's East End, and soon progressed to singing with some of the top big bands of the day such as those of Sidney Lipton, Nat Temple and Van Straten. In 1953, he auditioned for Norman Newell of Philips Records and was offered a recording contract.
In 1957, he had a contract with George Baines and Will Hammer and starred in "Big Splash", an Aqua Show at The Derby Baths, Blackpool, for the summer season.
He enjoyed three chart hits during this period, while signed to Philips: "I May Never Pass This Way Again" (No. 14) and "More Than Ever" ("Come prima") (No. 26) in 1958 and "The Wonderful Secret of Love" (No. 17) in 1959.His agent was Michael Sullivan, who also represented Shirley Bassey. After a 20-year career as a professional singer he retired in 1970, and then devoted much of his time to the Grand Order of Water Rats, a showbusiness charitable organization. He now lives in the United States. There are currently two CD of his recordings available, The Magic of Robert Earl (Spectrum) 2004 – 22 tracks; and If You Can Dream released in 2013 by Vocalion Records – with 30 tracks from the first 17 singles [1953 to 1958] - listed in the #Singles Discography below.
It is a mark of the esteem in which he was held by his peers that, in July 1989, some nineteen years after he retired, Earl sang "You'll Never Walk Alone", at the funeral service of his fellow Londoner, Tommy Trinder.
