He is best remembered today for his performance as Captain Hook in the Mary Martin musical production of Peter Pan. In 1945, he played Gabriele Eisenstein in Gay Rosalinda at the Palace theatre in London, a version of Strauss's Die Fledermaus by Erich Wolfgang Korngold in which he appeared with Peter Graves.

Ritchard was born in the Sydney suburb of Surry Hills. His parents were Sydney-born themselves: Herbert Trimnell-Ritchard, a Protestant grocer, and Marguerite, a Roman Catholic who raised her son in her faith. Educated by the Jesuits at St Aloysius' College, he studied medicine at Sydney University. His career in medicine was abandoned in 1917 when he decided to become an actor.
Dance teacher Minnie Hooper suggested Ritchard team up with one of her dancers, Madge Elliott, but Madge rejected him because he couldn't dance. Two years later, after a practice waltz, Madge and Cyril realized they were a team, and they went on a dancing tour of New Zealand.Madge and Cyril appeared in “Yes, Uncle!”  and “Going Up,” both in 1918. They then went their separate ways. Ritchard shared an apartment with Walter Pidgeon in New York while he appeared there, and Madge made her first West End appearance in 1925. Ritchard joined her in London and they reestablished the dancing partnership. In 1927 Laddie Cliff booked them to star in "Lady Luck" at the Carlton Theatre in 1927.In 1932 they returned to Australia where they were a hit. They appeared in a number of musicals, including "Blue Roses.” Their swan song performance in Australia was their wedding  ceremony was at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, in September 1935. There were said to be 5,000 onlookers at the wedding;  Madge's four-yard £400 veil had a starring role.Ritchard achieved star status in 1954 as Captain Hook in the Broadway production of “Peter Pan,” starring Mary Martin, who had the same birthday (1 December). For his work in the show, Ritchard received a Tony Award as Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Both Ritchard and Martin reprised their roles in the NBC television productions of the musical, beginning with a live color telecast in 1955. In 1958, he starred in the Cole Porter CBS television musical “Aladdin”. In 1959, he won his second Tony Award, for Best Actor in a Play, for “The Pleasure of His Company.”
He appeared onstage in “The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd” (1965), with Anthony Newley, and “Sugar“ (1972). He was also a Broadway director: “The Happiest Girl in the World“ (1961) (in which he also appeared), “Roar Like a Dove” (1964) and “The Irregular Verb to Love” (1963) (in which he also appeared).His film appearances include the role of the villain in Alfred Hitchcock's early talkie “Blackmail“ (1929) and much later in the Tommy Steele vehicle “Half a Sixpence“ (1967).

Ritchard also appeared regularly on a variety of television programs in the late 1950s and 1960s. For example, he appeared as a mystery guest on “What's My Line?” on the 22 December 1957 episode of the popular Sunday night CBS-TV program. In the 1950s Ritchard played the comic lead in Jacques Offenbach's operetta “La Perichole“ at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.
