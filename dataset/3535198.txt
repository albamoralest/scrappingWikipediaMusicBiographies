== First album and rise to fame ==
Livaneli was trying to go to Europe because he had gone to jail two times. For his first album, he didn't use his current name, Zülfü Livaneli. Instead, he used the name "Ozanoglu". Yet he did not get to the point where he wanted to be, therefore, he started using his current name, Zülfü Livaneli, on his new album, Chants Révolutionnaires Turcs (Turkish Revolutionary songs) in 1971 or 1973. When he was in Europe, his brother Ferhat informed him about how his songs were being sung by everyone in Turkey while they were protesting the government. Livaneli then made an album called Nazim Türküsü. The album turned the well renowned poet Nâzım Hikmet's poems to music and it became and stayed at the top hit on albums album for 48 weeks. 
In 1986, the Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis met Livaneli. They then proceeded to make an album called Güneş Topla Benim İçin (Gather The Sun For Me). After when the album was released in Turkey it was one of works at the peak of the Turkish music market. At that time Livaneli met Ahmet Kaya which was another folk singer. 1980s were the years Livaneli reached his first peak. The London Orchestra performed with Livaneli in 1998, and in 1999, UNESCO assisted Livaneli on the release of that album.


== Political life ==
Apart from his remarkable career as an author and poet, Livaneli was highly influential in Turkish politics over the last thirty years. In the 1994 Turkish local elections, he was nominated as candidate for mayorship of Istanbul by Social Democratic Populist Party but his bid failed. In the 2002 Turkish general election, Livaneli was elected to the Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi (Grand National Assembly of Turkey) as a Deputy for Istanbul for the Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (CHP). Livaneli resigned from the CHP in early 2005, however, in protest at "CHP's non-democratic and authoritarian system of politics",During his political career in Ankara, Livaneli presented a legislative proposal for amending Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. The amendment proposed that the concept of "Turkishness" should be replaced with that of the "Turkish nation" which would put an emphasis on the concept of "nation" which, as formulated by the Republic, unites under its umbrella people of different origins. With this amendment, there would no more be a stress on the notion of Turkish race.
Besides this, in 2006 he presented a proposal to the National Assembly demanding that a commission be established in order to investigate the reasons for increasing violence and fanaticism among the youth; his proposal was accepted.
Following his 2005 resignation from the party membership, Livaneli continued in his position in the Grand National Assembly as an independent until the end of that term. He did not take part in the 2007 Turkish elections and appears politically inactive. He has since concentrated on his art and books.
Livaneli was a daily contributor as a columnist in the newspapers Sabah, Vatan, and Milliyet.
